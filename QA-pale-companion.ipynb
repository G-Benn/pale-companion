What does this do?\n","Given a database of documents (focused around Wildbow serials), attempts to answers questions.\n","\n","# How does it do this?\n","For more details (or to recreate the steps yourself) please check out the Github README!\n","1. Vectorizes all chapters of the serials using a GPL fine-tuned SentenceTransformers models. These chapters are transformed into Documents of varying number of words (results can vary based on the sizes used) and stored in a database.\n","2. Processes your question into a vector of a similar format to the above.\n","3. Finds the Document(s) most similar to the question and returns them. This will also filter the documents.\n","4. From those documents, [Generate](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/reference/answer-generator-api#seq2seqgenerator) a few responses that answer those questions. This will also note what documents these answers came from in case you want to further explore manually.\n","5. In addition, [Extract](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/retriever#embedding-retrieval-recommended) a number of answer(s) directly that answer those questions. This can include full text of the answers\n","\n","# How do I use it?\n","0. If at all possible, go to `Change Runtime Type` in `Resources` and choose `GPU`. This should significantly speed up the queries. I have the best luck past 7pm ET for availability, but it's not strictly necessary.\n","1. Ensure that the database files (`wildbow_150.index`,`wildbow_150.json`,`wildbow_150_sqldb.db`, etc) are in the same location as `DB_FOLDER_LOCATION`. Colab can be finicky about how it attaches to GDrive so this may need some finangling. I've tried to leave 2 solutions in that each may work (you shouldn't need both).\n","2. There are a few variables defined in Cell X that can slightly change how everything behaves - feel free to experiment!\n","  - NUM_BEAMS: How many different [beams](https://towardsdatascience.com/foundations-of-nlp-explained-visually-beam-search-how-it-works-1586b9849a24) the Generator will produce for answer generation. Default is 8.\n","  - MAX_LENGTH: The maximum length of the sequence that will be generated. Keep in mind that a sequence will most likely naturally terminate before this is reached. Default is 500.\n","  - GENERATOR_TOPK: The number of answers that a Generator will return. Default is 3.\n","  - DATABASE_NAME: The name of the database that we'll search through to answer the questions. Options are `pale`, `otherverse` (comprising of Pale, Pact, Poke, and Pate), `parahumans` (comprising of Worm, Glow-worm, and Ward), `twig`, and `wildbow` (comprising of everything).\n","  - DOCUMENT_LENGTH: The size of the documents used in the database. This can cause the generator to return different results because of the information it ingests. `150`, `250`, `400`, `mixed` (storing all 3 types) are available here.\n","2. Run the cells through X - this will set everything up properly.\n","3. In Cell Y, specify the following variables:\n","  - QUESTION: Your question that you wish to ask.\n","  - RETRIEVER_TOPK: the number of documents that will be used to answer the question. Default is 15.\n","  - EXTRACT_TOPK: The number of extractive (raw text) answers you want to create. Similar to the GENERATOR_TOPK above.\n","\n","# Limitations\n","1. There is no ability to filter on series or chapters here due to [Database limitations](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/document_store#choosing-the-right-document-store). To get around this, I've included a few different databases (utilizing the same underlying embedding generation). Based on the series you select it should pull the correct db if everything has been formatted correctly. There is no way to filter to chapters. These may be fixed in a future version, but it requires a different Database setup that is harder to do in the Colab environment.\n","\n","# How accurate are the generated answers?\n","You're best off thinking of this like you're asking a mediocre fanfiction writer what the answer is - while they're enthusiastic about the series they probably only read part of it and don't exactly have a commitment to accuracy.\n","While the answers are grounded in truth, they're prone to a number of pitfalls:\n","  - Generative models are prone to favor likely combinations of words over rare combinations. This is especially true here as there is a specialized vocabulary for these series - the Generator doesn't know _exactly_ why \"Other\" is special or why \"Scion\" appears so often here and is less likely to select it as a high-probability. \n","  - It's only as good as the data it can build off of. Not only are these _stories_ where we're supposed to read between the lines and infer information, but those stories are told from biased character perspectives who receive half-truths from those around them. It's very gullible!\n","\n","## What about the extractive answers?\n","These answers are true to the text, but just keep in mind they're lacking context and persist things like character bias without additional information.\n","\n","\n","# Will there be any changes to this in the future?:\n","Nothing in-progress at the moment, but there's a few areas of potential here:\n","  - Change of database to allow filtering on metadata (eg only Pale, only chapters < 10.1, only Avery PoV, etc)\n","  - Different styles of answer generation. This type of work is relatively simple to do within the Haystack framework but it relies on a custom [Converter](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack/blob/main/haystack/nodes/answer_generator/transformers.py#L481) being written. See [this](https://yjernite.github.io/lfqa.html) for an explanation on what is involved in getting a new LFQA generator working.\n","  - A Generator that can better mimic the style of Wildbow's answers. This would rely on a source-of-truth set of Document:Summary data that would be difficult to compile. However, it would both provide a more familiar output style and potentially could teach the model some of the vocabulary quirks that are present in the worlds (eg Other in the PactVerse != other in common usage). Similar to the above.\n","  - A better way to capture rare words (like Primordial, Aurum) in the answers - in NLP this is called [temperature](https://lukesalamone.github.io/posts/what-is-temperature/). While you typically don't want high amounts of creativity in your QA system, it can help make up for other shortcomings like the lack of trained vocabulary. This would require [MonkeyPatching](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5626193/what-is-monkey-patching) or other general modifications of the [Haystack source code](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack/blob/main/haystack/nodes/answer_generator/transformers.py#L465) which could be a large endeavor. \n","  - A better pretraining on real questions and answers. The pretraining here is done via a technique called [Generative Pseudolabeling](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/gpl/), but it's no substitute for stronger training data for domain adaption.\n","  - The inclusion of various Word-of-God quotes or user-submitted answers to other queries (ie Reddit, Discord). The difficulty here is parsing the data formats and gathering it into formats that 1) better inform the Document embeddings how to store the information, 2) can be searched efficiently, and 3) are correct.\n","  - Updating Pale chapters available - currently the initial dataset only includes Pale chapters up to 23.1. This would be an incremental update.\n","  - Incorporating the possibility of a MultiModal Transformer for the Extra Materials. Currently any information from the Pale Extra Materials are included via transcripts manually pulled from the site(many thanks to those who transcribed this information) but the possibility of searching text and image embeddings simultaneously is a possibility."],"metadata":{"id":"4xkyYbD-Xajo"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"id":"5YzfjrlQXRaz","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1681619225987,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":8,"user":{"displayName":"Gibson

She reached into her inside coat pocket, then pulled out a folded up printout.  She held it out.  Mike was the one who approached to take it.  He glanced up at Jude.  “Hi,” Jude said.  Verona smiled as she saw Mike die inside.  Mike retreated to the others, passed the paper to Davion, almost slapping it into his chest, clearly dejected.  Davion unfolded it.  “What’s this?” Steyn asked.  “Opportunity,” Verona told him.  “The Carmine has scared just about every valid practitioner out of the area, every practitioner or family that wasn’t set up by the Carmine.”  “Yeah,” Steyn replied, not looking happy.  “My family moved.”  Of the three, Steyn came from a practitioner family.  A very, very small one, without much impact.  Evicted from the Carmine’s domain.  He’d grouped up with the other two, who’d stumbled on an Oni, way back when.  They’d set up camp here, apparently, well before the whole Carmine thing had happened.  They’d been invited to the Blue Heron, probably because Alexander figured whatever tidbits of information they could give or leak on the Oni they interacted with were worth the trouble and free tuition.  As far as Verona knew, they kind of mostly hung out here.  “But we don’t serve the Carmine.  The Carmine is meant to serve and represent us.  So I want to organize something.  A debate.  With specific, Carmine-related practitioners.”  “A sword moot,” Lucy said.  “And you’re coming to us?”  “You’re combat practitioners, you qualify.  We’re going around to just about everyone.  And I’m going to let you know now, this is part of a plan to take down the Carmine.  To do that, we need him tied up in this.”  “It’s the holidays.”  “We already removed the Alabaster, we put a regional spirit in place, I don’t think many would complain about a representative of the area being a representative of the area, as that area was, when we created her,” Lucy said.  “He should be in the hole, as far as his power reserves go, but that probably ends soon.”  “Offer us something,” Steyn said.  “If we start giving gifts and bribes to get people on board, we’ll be in a pinch when it comes to working with anything bigger,” Verona told Lucy.  Lucy nodded.  “Then I don’t see why we should,” Steyn replied.

At the shout, they startled, took a step back, then stopped.  “Or we’ll take it as hostile action,” Griffin added.  “They’re retreating toward the door,” Kira-Lynn murmured.  Nomi held the scarab, moved her hand, and bid the undead to drop from the window, circling back.  Finding their way inside, reaching the back room where furniture was stored, and then lurking in wait there.  “They’re from Kennet,” a woman said.  One of the ones who’d been whispering.  The man at the front relaxed visibly.  “Oh.  Well, we should be good then.”  “Should we?” Lenard asked.  He creeped Nomi out so much.  More than the undead.  The wormy lips, bug-out eyes, heavy cheeks and lack of a chin.  Like some Other had eaten all the weird kids in grade school and grew to adult size.  Except he also had that look in his eyes.  Wary, raw, dark.  A lot of the teachers had that look.  “We’re friends of the market.  Or- I should say we’re friends of friends of the market.  We trade to people who are starting to sell to the market.”  “Congratulations, by the way,” a woman said.  “Congratulations?” Teddy asked.  “On the Promenade?  Lots of people are talking.  Impressive.”  The other three.  They did something.  It felt like she felt with Cameron, except worse.  These three girls, racing ahead, doing big things.  Stealing their chance at Musser out from under them, when they were right there, moments away.  “We’re not with the market,” Seth said, hands in his pockets, looking very casual.  Very handsome.  The six studied them.  “Carmine?” the one in the lead asked.  “Where are you from?”  “You’re supporting what the Carmine is doing?  You’re going to drive all the practitioners out of the region.”  “As a start.”  “What’s he giving you?”  “Do you really want to see?” Lenard asked.  “No.  Because that sounds like a threat.”  “Tell us where you’re from.  Who you’re in contact with.”  “So you can get us at home?  Go after our contacts?  No.”  “Joshua?” Lenard asked.  “No,” Yiyun said.  “Not without protection for the kids.

That’s what I’m saying.  Them?  Getting back on topic?” Lucy asked, pointing at Kira-Lynn.  “Fuck you,” Kira-Lynn said.  “I think we should define stuff.  Get the Carmine on the record, explaining his logic… if there is any.  How he could protect kids at the start, how he could justify this.  Is he going to put his name on them, call them his?  Or disown them?  And then I’d like to get a firm answer on whether they’re awakened or not.”  “You do seem to be dwelling in the gray areas, Carmine,” Palaisy said.  “Bad dog,” Ann scolded.  “That was the last Carmine, you complete twit,” Charles retorted, standing from his seat.  “So this was what you’re after?” the oldest of the St. Victor’s boys asked.  “You’re a sore loser after Joshua decided he didn’t like Abyssal insanity practice and bailed?”  “Ran from a losing fight and all consequences for his actions,” Lucy said.  “You’re playing fast and loose with the rules?

They have their own interpretations for the different… systems.  How they enforce rules, how they act, how they interpret.”  “They stand in for the collective unconscious.  For the ambient spirits, for the seats unclaimed.  If there are no spirit lords in the area, they’ll be the spirit lord where spirits need leadership.

When those forces and others are away, they arrange defense against the forces where not defending isn’t an option.”  “And they manage karma, decide forswearing cases,” Lucy said.  “Yes.”  “The Carmine was the one who twisted your ritual incarnate into the Choir?” Avery asked.  “She gave things the push they needed to go astray, and let the pieces fall in a way that would hurt me most.  Damn all the rest of them, am I right?  Damn the men, damn the women, damn the children, damn the communities, friends, and family.

Avery glanced at them, saw Charles breathing hard, a bit of spit still there where scraggly beard drooped over the corner of his mouth, and looked away.

Study first, then act.  I don’t think you guys get what the Carmine Exile is about.

A Mr. Neumann.  Abyssal scourge.  “Yeah, he’s a Judge, but the Judges act on certain principles.  The Alabaster is meant to represent that there’s always a way, always a helping hand, a place to go.  Without that, stuff gets screwy.  We were screwy, we were screwed, for a while.  Maybe that changes with the new Alabaster.”  So many eyes were on her.  So many ears were listening.  “The Carmine represents another principle.  It’s a bit of a counter-principle to the Alabaster.  It’s also complimentary.  The way they’re balanced against one another, they play off each other like that.  The Carmine represents, as I see it, the idea that you can always be threatened, there’s always something with more teeth, to eat the vulnerable and complacent.  Something to need sanctuary from.”  Some people glanced at Charles.  “I think that’s why he got some of the leeway he did.

She couldn’t get out of the river.  If she followed it, waited to pick her battles, then she was running, almost always with one paw in contact with the soil, feeling that thud far away.  Something big.  A man on horseback.  She lunged from the woods, just in front of the rider, from trees to trees, her paws barely touching the path itself.  She leaped from one point of river to another, hurdling a rock that she might otherwise have slid into.  The horse reared up, eyes wild, and threw its rider.  The man fell, the bags he’d been riding with spilling over.  “You’re so good at this,” Brooklyn said, leaning over.  Her head turned.  She was in class.

No nose, no mouth, just very big eyes.  “Very nice,” the teacher said.  Focus.  She was the Beast, and she moved through the woods, aware of the attention she got.  The fear, the respect, the amusement from goblin things.  She moved naturally, following a course she couldn’t pull away from, a train on its rails, but she was fur, paw, and something vulpine.

One of the teachers.  Chinese-Canadian, long-haired.  She had fled her family with her daughter in tow, hoping to save her daughter.  She hadn’t, even after being forsworn in her efforts to rescue the girl.  If any would have reservations about children, it would be her.  “Them being young is the point,” the Carmine Exile said.  “We’re not that young,” Nomi said.  “There is a standard process for Awakening, a standard diagram” the Carmine Exile told them.  He paced around the gymnasium.  Around the non-standard diagram that had the students at the center, teachers ringing the perimeter.  The Aurum and the two other judges were standing or sitting at cardinal points, around the edges of the room.  The Carmine was taking the long way around to getting to his spot.  The Carmine Exile went on talking, telling them, “But it’s not obligatory.  There are other paths.  Someone can be introduced to the world of Others by a higher power, or they can run up against the supernatural so often and so forcefully that no Innocence remains.”  The ex-Forsworn and children hung onto his every word.  “Some of you five are here because you need power.  Some because you’ve tasted Awareness, you’ve seen that this town is changing and you know you’re on the outside of that change.  Some of you have natural talent and the willingness to exercise it.  Even when it means breaking into the school at a late hour.  Facing down people like your teachers here.  Facing me, the Aurum, the Sable, the Alabaster.”  One of the boys, Teddy, made a greater effort to meet the Carmine’s eyes, as if rising to the challenge.  “Something brought you here and keeps you here.  Something will keep you here when things get more intense,” the Carmine said.  He was halfway around the circle now.  “You have your reasons.”  There were some nods.  Teacher stared at student, studying them.  Each teacher had come from the lowest points a practitioner could reach.  Many looked to see if the children had what it took to survive reaching those points, if it should come to that.  For weakness.  For strength.  “The typical process for this is a binding oath.

The red of his fur coat and the rest of him seemed to sink into the snow, spreading out, turning it a shocking, bright crimson.  “May I take this off your hands?” the Carmine Exile asked the Alabaster Doe.  “You’ve taken on so many duties already.”  “Take it as a vacation.  A chance to rest,” he told her.  “It’s custom for a judge to allow another judge to take on any duty they see fit.  The divisions are arbitrary.”  “I do know the customs, Carmine Exile, you can trust that,” the Alabaster said.  She looked at Seth with cold, empty eyes.  “Do as you wish.”  As she left, the red spread further, coloring all snow, bleeding up through the trees.  As it spread far enough, the sky above them even reflected that redness in the clouds, faint.  “Unless you have an objection?” the Carmine Exile asked Seth.  “No.  But I didn’t fight.  The Carmine usually handles the… fights.”  “You’re fighting now, in a way.  So tell me.  You had Nicolette drive for almost a full day and night.  You trudged these last three hundred feet through the woods.  What do you want?”  “I said it earlier.”  “And I must hear it now.”  “I ask to appeal.  I don’t know the grounds I could do it on.  Nicolette said- that maybe it couldn’t be transferred to Alexander.”  “You’d think that with everything on the line, you’d find better.”  “She had better, I just- my mind’s a blank.  I’m cold.  And I’m not sure I deserve better.  A part of me is hoping you’ll say no and leave me to die.”  “I see that part very clearly, with all my senses.  Yet you’re here,” the Carmine Exile said.  The Carmine Exile seated himself in snow that was now so thick with blood that Seth’s hand was coated when he lifted it up and away.  “I understand,” the Carmine Exile whispered.  “That self-hatred.  The frustration.  The hopelessness.”  “You were forsworn too.”  “I understood all those things well before I was forsworn, well after.  I know you felt that way before.

Verona smiled as she saw Mike die inside.  Mike retreated to the others, passed the paper to Davion, almost slapping it into his chest, clearly dejected.  Davion unfolded it.  “What’s this?” Steyn asked.  “Opportunity,” Verona told him.  “The Carmine has scared just about every valid practitioner out of the area, every practitioner or family that wasn’t set up by the Carmine.”  “Yeah,” Steyn replied, not looking happy.  “My family moved.”  Of the three, Steyn came from a practitioner family.  A very, very small one, without much impact.  Evicted from the Carmine’s domain.  He’d grouped up with the other two, who’d stumbled on an Oni, way back when.  They’d set up camp here, apparently, well before the whole Carmine thing had happened.  They’d been invited to the Blue Heron, probably because Alexander figured whatever tidbits of information they could give or leak on the Oni they interacted with were worth the trouble and free tuition.  As far as Verona knew, they kind of mostly hung out here.  “But we don’t serve the Carmine.  The Carmine is meant to serve and represent us.  So I want to organize something.  A debate.  With specific, Carmine-related practitioners.”  “A sword moot,” Lucy said.  “And you’re coming to us?”  “You’re combat practitioners, you qualify.  We’re going around to just about everyone.  And I’m going to let you know now, this is part of a plan to take down the Carmine.  To do that, we need him tied up in this.”  “It’s the holidays.”  “We already removed the Alabaster, we put a regional spirit in place, I don’t think many would complain about a representative of the area being a representative of the area, as that area was, when we created her,” Lucy said.  “He should be in the hole, as far as his power reserves go, but that probably ends soon.”  “Offer us something,” Steyn said.  “If we start giving gifts and bribes to get people on board, we’ll be in a pinch when it comes to working with anything bigger,” Verona told Lucy.

Nomi held the scarab, moved her hand, and bid the undead to drop from the window, circling back.  Finding their way inside, reaching the back room where furniture was stored, and then lurking in wait there.  “They’re from Kennet,” a woman said.  One of the ones who’d been whispering.

Stealing their chance at Musser out from under them, when they were right there, moments away.  “We’re not with the market,” Seth said, hands in his pockets, looking very casual.  Very handsome.

When those forces and others are away, they arrange defense against the forces where not defending isn’t an option.”  “And they manage karma, decide forswearing cases,” Lucy said.  “Yes.”  “The Carmine was the one who twisted your ritual incarnate into the Choir?” Avery asked.  “She gave things the push they needed to go astray, and let the pieces fall in a way that would hurt me most.  Damn all the rest of them, am I right?  Damn the men, damn the women, damn the children, damn the communities, friends, and family.  Damn those sorry individuals who felt they had no choice but to do some ritual they read about on a newsletter or online!”  A fleck of spit flew from his lips as he raised his voice.  “Let them eat each other alive, let them die violently at the hands of animals, let them get pulled from the meat of their bodies to join the Choir!  At least she fucking got me!  How’s that?  Set that into motion and then she let it be and there we fucking go, she got to rub my face in my failure again, as if I wasn’t already fucking aware of it all, and Alexander got another chance to act the hero and grow his status, and I get the victims on my conscience!”  They didn’t have an immediate response for him.  Lucy went from leaning over her chair to turning away, arms folded.  Verona looked down at the table.  Avery glanced at them, saw Charles breathing hard, a bit of spit still there where scraggly beard drooped over the corner of his mouth, and looked away.

The first had been that she knew Charles hated what the established practitioners represented.  The second was this.  That Others would come.

People were distracted enough studying the new arrivals that there was a gap.  “I’m reminded of the lessons we were taught at the Blue Heron,” Lucy said.  “I feel like some experienced practitioners here need a refresher.”  “Oh do we?” Ann Wint asked.  “Know your enemy.  Study first, then act.  I don’t think you guys get what the Carmine Exile is about.

A Mr. Neumann.  Abyssal scourge.  “Yeah, he’s a Judge, but the Judges act on certain principles.  The Alabaster is meant to represent that there’s always a way, always a helping hand, a place to go.  Without that, stuff gets screwy.  We were screwy, we were screwed, for a while.  Maybe that changes with the new Alabaster.”  So many eyes were on her.  So many ears were listening.  “The Carmine represents another principle.  It’s a bit of a counter-principle to the Alabaster.  It’s also complimentary.  The way they’re balanced against one another, they play off each other like that.  The Carmine represents, as I see it, the idea that you can always be threatened, there’s always something with more teeth, to eat the vulnerable and complacent.  Something to need sanctuary from.”  Some people glanced at Charles.  “I think that’s why he got some of the leeway he did.

She could the feel of the earth through her paws, in her paws.  The river was there.  She was dimly aware of it.  Steering this, driving it toward where she needed it to be, it was hard.  She couldn’t get out of the river.  If she followed it, waited to pick her battles, then she was running, almost always with one paw in contact with the soil, feeling that thud far away.  Something big.  A man on horseback.  She lunged from the woods, just in front of the rider, from trees to trees, her paws barely touching the path itself.  She leaped from one point of river to another, hurdling a rock that she might otherwise have slid into.  The horse reared up, eyes wild, and threw its rider.  The man fell, the bags he’d been riding with spilling over.  “You’re so good at this,” Brooklyn said, leaning over.  Her head turned.  She was in class.  Her artwork was picked up by her teacher, which annoyed her because it wasn’t done.  It was a cat, drawn with only tight zig-zags, each one carefully arranged to suggest shape.  No nose, no mouth, just very big eyes.  “Very nice,” the teacher said.  Focus.  She was the Beast, and she moved through the woods, aware of the attention she got.  The fear, the respect, the amusement from goblin things.  She moved naturally, following a course she couldn’t pull away from, a train on its rails, but she was fur, paw, and something vulpine.

The school was tiny, about a third of the size of the public school, and more parents seemed to send their kids there because it was ‘nice’ and had the small class sizes than because they were religious.  “We were changing things,” Miss told her.

Something will keep you here when things get more intense,” the Carmine said.  He was halfway around the circle now.  “You have your reasons.”  There were some nods.  Teacher stared at student, studying them.  Each teacher had come from the lowest points a practitioner could reach.  Many looked to see if the children had what it took to survive reaching those points, if it should come to that.  For weakness.  For strength.  “The typical process for this is a binding oath.

The woman who has given you sanctuary waits for you.  You may go to her.”  “Or,” the voice was rough.  “You may come to me.”  Seth raised his head.  Charles Abrams, Carmine Exile, stood in the snow.  The red of his fur coat and the rest of him seemed to sink into the snow, spreading out, turning it a shocking, bright crimson.  “May I take this off your hands?” the Carmine Exile asked the Alabaster Doe.  “You’ve taken on so many duties already.”  “Take it as a vacation.  A chance to rest,” he told her.  “It’s custom for a judge to allow another judge to take on any duty they see fit.  The divisions are arbitrary.”  “I do know the customs, Carmine Exile, you can trust that,” the Alabaster said.  She looked at Seth with cold, empty eyes.  “Do as you wish.”  As she left, the red spread further, coloring all snow, bleeding up through the trees.  As it spread far enough, the sky above them even reflected that redness in the clouds, faint.  “Unless you have an objection?” the Carmine Exile asked Seth.  “No.  But I didn’t fight.  The Carmine usually handles the… fights.”  “You’re fighting now, in a way.  So tell me.  You had Nicolette drive for almost a full day and night.  You trudged these last three hundred feet through the woods.  What do you want?”  “I said it earlier.”  “And I must hear it now.”  “I ask to appeal.  I don’t know the grounds I could do it on.  Nicolette said- that maybe it couldn’t be transferred to Alexander.”  “You’d think that with everything on the line, you’d find better.”  “She had better, I just- my mind’s a blank.  I’m cold.  And I’m not sure I deserve better.  A part of me is hoping you’ll say no and leave me to die.”  “I see that part very clearly, with all my senses.  Yet you’re here,” the Carmine Exile said.  The Carmine Exile seated himself in snow that was now so thick with blood that Seth’s hand was coated when he lifted it up and away.  “I understand,” the Carmine Exile whispered.  “That self-hatred.  The frustration.  The hopelessness.”  “You were forsworn too.”  “I understood all those things well before I was forsworn, well after.  I know you felt that way before.
