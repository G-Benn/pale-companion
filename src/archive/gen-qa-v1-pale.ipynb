But he’s had wake up calls about what the world had in store for him.  A tough first semester.”  “I stand by the idea that if everyone in the world was more like Booker, the world would be in a great place,” Lucy said, a little haughty, or affronted.  “How old is he?” Avery’s mom asked.  “Eighteen.  He’s off at University.”  “We have one that just finished.  Jude’s oldest brother.  ', 'Avery hopped up and walked over the car, checking the road before hopping down.  Maricica was there.  So was Lis.  The pair of them faced Guilherme, who fast-walked to keep a damaged, parked car between himself and the corner of the building, where Clint, Rocky, and other Witch Hunters were gathered.  Freak, Squeak, Chloe, Nibble, Tashlit, a full assortment of goblins that included Toadswallow, and Matthew Moss were at another corner of the building, ready to act but unwilling to cross the Witch Hunters.  And Musser stood on the rooftop with Raquel and his assembled Others.  ', 'And mom and dad, and even bite size Declan, all giving me one hundred percent of their pity, their attention, cooing over me, and all I wanted was to be a grumpy preteen, and they wouldn’t let me.  Now Avery’s about that age, and she’s even more, like… off doing her own thing.”  “Is she?” Lucy asked.  “Isn’t she?  It’s just like… mom and dad are handling the school stuff and making sure she’s cool, and Grumble’s all buddy-buddy with her, and I ask her how her sports are doing because I’m giving her a ride half the time.  ', 'Avery’s friends.”  “Hi.”  “Hi,” Lucy replied.  “Verdict?” Rowan asked.  “He said no,” Laurie answered, looking perturbed.  She glanced back at the guy, who was vaguely goblin-ish.  He had more hair sticking up the back of his shirt toward his neck than he had on top of his head, and when he was looking down at the papers strewn across one portion of the front counter, it looked a lot like the line of his chin meeting the flab of his neck was a second mouth.  “What’s the paper?” Lucy asked.  ', 'I only found out about it this fall.  I haven’t Awakened, I’m only here to keep her company and help where I can.  She’s the one who knows more about what’s going on.”  The older man didn’t look impressed with that.  “Sit.”  Avery sat, putting her bag at her feet.  Her dad and Snowdrop sat as well.  “I’m Gene Harlow.  The pair here to my left are Helena and David Stately.  Sitting to my right are Lea Littlewood and Joe Gagnon.”  “Pleased to meet you.  Oh, hm.  ', 'Avery’s parents?  Lucy didn’t recognize the color in the gloom.  Avery let Snowdrop down onto the grass as they got closer.  “Meet in Lucy’s room?”  Snowdrop sneezed in the affirmative and bounded off into a hedge.  Lucy wondered how she’d get her keys, with a bag in her hand and the other arm in a sling, but it was a short lived wondering.  Her mom was at the door before they were halfway across the lawn, opening it for them.  “Come on in, hon,” Lucy’s mom said, to Verona.  “How was the interview?” Lucy asked.  ', '“How old is he?” Avery’s mom asked.  “Eighteen.  He’s off at University.”  “We have one that just finished.  Jude’s oldest brother.  We pay him to draft texts we sell to the practitioner community, he’s putting the money toward a home, allegedly.”  “Allegedly,” Jude’s dad stressed.  “It’s fine.  So long as he puts up with us when we ask for help configuring the television systems, I won’t ask too many questions.”  Jude’s silence felt like a crushing weight on Avery’s chest.  Sucked.  Really sucked.  “We make them learn first aid.  But that’s good for any kid to know.  ', 'Avery sat with her chair near the wall, facing Jeanine.  Which, like… Jeanine was nice to look at, hit all the marks.  Jeanine was interested.  She drew on Snowdrop energy and checkmarks to keep from getting flustered, sorting out her bag, getting a notebook and pen out.  The guy looked agitated, Jeanine was distracted looking around the class, and the girl in the back corner looked ready to fall asleep.  “Two people per group, one to the front left corner, one to the front right!” the teacher announced.  “Separate packets.  Do not open the folders.”  “Mrs. ', 'Avery couldn’t really see it because Lucy and Lucy’s hair were in the way,and it was on the far side of NIcolette’s head, but it looked like blue feathers.  “Normally, when I’m working for Alexander, I’d approach a client with a few opening questions.  Making sure I have the lay of the land, and that they have the understanding of what’s going on that I think they do.”  “Isn’t it past tense?  You working for Alexander?” Lucy asked.  ', 'Hi, Avery.”  “Hi.”  Avery’s parents were inside, standing in the hallway and with them standing in the way of the kitchen, the stairwell dark, it was like the only path forward was to the living room.  Verona kind of automatically went that way, pushed by a general ‘Verona’ desire to evade the crowds.  And it was crowded.  Lucy followed her friend into the living room.

But he’s had wake up calls about what the world had in store for him.  A tough first semester.”  “I stand by the idea that if everyone in the world was more like Booker, the world would be in a great place,” Lucy said, a little haughty, or affronted.  “How old is he?” Avery’s mom asked.  “Eighteen.  He’s off at University.”  “We have one that just finished.  Jude’s oldest brother.  ', 'Avery hopped up and walked over the car, checking the road before hopping down.  Maricica was there.  So was Lis.  The pair of them faced Guilherme, who fast-walked to keep a damaged, parked car between himself and the corner of the building, where Clint, Rocky, and other Witch Hunters were gathered.  Freak, Squeak, Chloe, Nibble, Tashlit, a full assortment of goblins that included Toadswallow, and Matthew Moss were at another corner of the building, ready to act but unwilling to cross the Witch Hunters.  And Musser stood on the rooftop with Raquel and his assembled Others.  ', 'And mom and dad, and even bite size Declan, all giving me one hundred percent of their pity, their attention, cooing over me, and all I wanted was to be a grumpy preteen, and they wouldn’t let me.  Now Avery’s about that age, and she’s even more, like… off doing her own thing.”  “Is she?” Lucy asked.  “Isn’t she?  It’s just like… mom and dad are handling the school stuff and making sure she’s cool, and Grumble’s all buddy-buddy with her, and I ask her how her sports are doing because I’m giving her a ride half the time.  ', 'Avery’s friends.”  “Hi.”  “Hi,” Lucy replied.  “Verdict?” Rowan asked.  “He said no,” Laurie answered, looking perturbed.  She glanced back at the guy, who was vaguely goblin-ish.  He had more hair sticking up the back of his shirt toward his neck than he had on top of his head, and when he was looking down at the papers strewn across one portion of the front counter, it looked a lot like the line of his chin meeting the flab of his neck was a second mouth.  “What’s the paper?” Lucy asked.  ', 'I only found out about it this fall.  I haven’t Awakened, I’m only here to keep her company and help where I can.  She’s the one who knows more about what’s going on.”  The older man didn’t look impressed with that.  “Sit.”  Avery sat, putting her bag at her feet.  Her dad and Snowdrop sat as well.  “I’m Gene Harlow.  The pair here to my left are Helena and David Stately.  Sitting to my right are Lea Littlewood and Joe Gagnon.”  “Pleased to meet you.  Oh, hm.  ', 'Avery’s parents?  Lucy didn’t recognize the color in the gloom.  Avery let Snowdrop down onto the grass as they got closer.  “Meet in Lucy’s room?”  Snowdrop sneezed in the affirmative and bounded off into a hedge.  Lucy wondered how she’d get her keys, with a bag in her hand and the other arm in a sling, but it was a short lived wondering.  Her mom was at the door before they were halfway across the lawn, opening it for them.  “Come on in, hon,” Lucy’s mom said, to Verona.  “How was the interview?” Lucy asked.  ', '“How old is he?” Avery’s mom asked.  “Eighteen.  He’s off at University.”  “We have one that just finished.  Jude’s oldest brother.  We pay him to draft texts we sell to the practitioner community, he’s putting the money toward a home, allegedly.”  “Allegedly,” Jude’s dad stressed.  “It’s fine.  So long as he puts up with us when we ask for help configuring the television systems, I won’t ask too many questions.”  Jude’s silence felt like a crushing weight on Avery’s chest.  Sucked.  Really sucked.  “We make them learn first aid.  But that’s good for any kid to know.  ', 'Avery sat with her chair near the wall, facing Jeanine.  Which, like… Jeanine was nice to look at, hit all the marks.  Jeanine was interested.  She drew on Snowdrop energy and checkmarks to keep from getting flustered, sorting out her bag, getting a notebook and pen out.  The guy looked agitated, Jeanine was distracted looking around the class, and the girl in the back corner looked ready to fall asleep.  “Two people per group, one to the front left corner, one to the front right!” the teacher announced.  “Separate packets.  Do not open the folders.”  “Mrs. ', 'Avery couldn’t really see it because Lucy and Lucy’s hair were in the way,and it was on the far side of NIcolette’s head, but it looked like blue feathers.  “Normally, when I’m working for Alexander, I’d approach a client with a few opening questions.  Making sure I have the lay of the land, and that they have the understanding of what’s going on that I think they do.”  “Isn’t it past tense?  You working for Alexander?” Lucy asked.  ', 'Hi, Avery.”  “Hi.”  Avery’s parents were inside, standing in the hallway and with them standing in the way of the kitchen, the stairwell dark, it was like the only path forward was to the living room.  Verona kind of automatically went that way, pushed by a general ‘Verona’ desire to evade the crowds.  And it was crowded.  Lucy followed her friend into the living room.  Booker and Alyssa were in the backyard, beneath the porch light, which was swarming with mosquitoes.  The door was closed, and Lucy could see him through the glass.  He raised a hand in a wave.

Dog Tags were on duty, keeping tabs on things, and it felt like everything else was in a weird kind of suspension.  Avery chief among those things.  The sky was bright after the perpetual twilight sky of Kennet found, and it made the snow brighter too.

', 'Verona and I are friends,” Jeremy replied.  Mr. Sitton was their homeroom teacher.  Lucy hid her distaste as she saw him greeting them.  “Mr. Jeremy Clifford, the talented artist.  Always a pleasure to have a top student back, Wallace.  Mia, congratulations, I heard Wavy Tree did fantastic this summer.  Miss Ellingson, how are you this fine day?”  She smiled awkwardly at that, without responding.  When they were a safe distance away, she asked, “Does Mr. Sitton use a different tone of voice with me or is it all in my head?”  “I wasn’t listening,” Jeremy replied.  ', 'Verona was coming in from Guelph, the next city over.  Avery was a little faster as a bird who didn’t need to worry about bends in the road.  She did need to worry about men with guns, and there were some by most of the roads in and out of the three cities.  She was three-quarters of the way around when she felt the wind around her, ruffling feathers, tweaking a tail feather.  Snowdrop squawked.  She kept going.  Finishing the loop.  The wind moved away, then rejoined her.  Avery descended, plunging.  The wind swirled around her.  ', 'Verona was out there, doing her own thing- she’d started her morning later, and was going to set out later and meet with Lucy.  Dog Tags were on duty, keeping tabs on things, and it felt like everything else was in a weird kind of suspension.  Avery chief among those things.  The sky was bright after the perpetual twilight sky of Kennet found, and it made the snow brighter too.  The chateau – the rest stop where skiiers could stop in for hot chocolate and concessions, or prepackaged sandwiches and coffee was still cordoned off, as was the Killalloe Dough.  ', 'Verona sat between where she leaned and Tashlit, and Avery stood off to the side, hands in pockets, strawberry blonde hair blowing across her freckled face without her fixing it while she watched the horizon.  “Thanks for coming, John,” Lucy said.  “Of course,” he replied.  “And for guarding my date, I guess.”  “Toadswallow wanted to interrupt it altogether, just in case.  I remember you were tense about protecting your mom,” John said.  “When we were exiling Maricica.”  “Yeah,” Lucy replied.  “You get the privilege of growing up, of living a full life.  ', 'Verona’s hooded top had a ‘v’ at the neck and dipped low enough that the drawing at her neck and collarbone was visible.  “In case things got violent,” Lucy answered.  “I don’t think I would have thought to do that when I was your age, or known what to draw.”  “I was at this for barely more than a week when I got stranded at the Forest Ribbon Trail,” Avery said, skipping up the steps and pausing at the railing before entering the front door.  ', 'Verona was as mad as a wet cat after the divorce, her dad whispering in one ear, her mom not pushing back or doing the same back.  She pushed her mom away, her dad pushed her away, she was busy, had a lot of opportunities, and nobody but her seemed to want her to stick around, so she went.  Now she’s out of the loop.  She said Verona asked about her moving back here and letting her move in-”\\n\\n“Chance to reconnect?”\\n\\n“But she wasn’t in a position to.  ', 'Verona had just gotten the smallest size of poutine with chicken, even though the poutine at Heros wasn’t that good.  The conversation on the way had been casual, intermittent, mostly focused on the events of school and the morning, with a pointed avoidance of any mention of practice or Others.  At first, at least for Lucy, it had been because they were surrounded by a mob of students, then in the middle of a line.

A shadow standing in the window of a vacant apartment, he watched.  His finger touched the base of the old windowframe and oozed out, and an ear formed in the ooze.  She was with a friend, who wore her hair in locs, with a black wool jacket that was heavier than the weather required, and a bag that was similarly massive, making her look smaller than she was.  ', 'The man was gone, and Gilkey had been born from that, an eroded Self at his core that had no real attachment to the man, aside from the fact that the man’s last moments had been some of Gilkey’s first.  Gilkey remembered the grief, the desperate setup of the wards before his brain had turned into gelatin in his skull.  Wards to keep people away and keep the poison contained.  Now things had settled.  The house would be death to anyone who entered, but the poison wasn’t likely to proliferate.  ', 'But she applied, she does good work.  I pay.  I help her on occasion.  Perhaps she’ll earn enough to find a way.  So long as you survive, all things are possible.”  “You offered this information expecting something more than a gift,” Gilkey told the Vendor.  “Did you want a certain result?  Removing her to… avert some disaster?  Helping you to survive?”  “Do what you will.  If you destroy her, it’s some currency with the people she’s left so devastated in her wake.”  “Could I destroy her?  Are there guards here?  ', 'She didn’t move like the dog had, except to draw in tighter, chest at the child’s back, legs curled under the child’s rear end.  Her neck was injured, the gelatin mottled.  In his first hours of existence, Gilkey had thought they were alive like he was.  He’d brought-  He saw it.  The shelf, lying on the ground.  Handprints marked where he’d held it with the poison still fresh and fierce in his system.  He’d brought down over and over again.  Now he knew they were only animated here and there by echoes.  He left them behind.  ', 'Gilkey wanted to hear the conversation they had after this meeting, but Odis would be too careful about that.  A part of him wanted that kind of dynamic.  No, wanting was the wrong word.  He yearned for it, as if it was something he’d had but lost.  Except he’d never had it that he could remember.  “If you have dangerous captives, I’d think you’d pay more mind to them,” Tomas remarked, tone conversational.  “You learned under Odis.”  It was Odis who replied.  ', 'In their hubris, they’d been more prone to destroying themselves and each other.  Sabotage became a kind of cold war.  Most fell, others withdrew or fled the area, and too many scattered, ill-fated projects and mistakes were left in the area.  Gilkey didn’t know if the man he’d been had been dosed with a vicious poison by a rival, then come here, where he hoped to counter the poisoning, where he knew there were wards.  If he had, that had been a terrible mistake.  The wards hadn’t held.  Perhaps he’d tried to make a poison.  ', 'Gilkey, are you an assassin?  Or a fighter?”  “No.  I watch, I bring messages.”  “Can I… help with that?” Avery asked the Lord.  “I’ve done a lot of surveillance, I’ve protected a perimeter, I have the tools, I’m fast, I can run messages.  Not- I’m not trying to take your spot, Gilkey.”  “It’s fine.  But I’m an Other, Avery Kelly.”  “I’m okay getting the same responsibilities.  I’m not trying to grow a practitioner family or anything.  ', 'It landed on the chair with a clatter, and the startled Typetap Kitty darted away, slipping beneath the bookshelves, with only a credit card’s thickness of space beneath.  Yellow eyes peered out from beneath, two dimensional and flat against the floor.  Abraham Musser approached, and the Typetap Kitty watched as his eyes started glowing.  It retreated.  To avoid being seen, it did a circuit around the apartment.  Once it had been one of Basil Winters favored summonings.  It had learned tricks, learned what to watch for.  Basil was gone.  ', 'He was crapping out the same bloody slurry.  He collapsed, and instead of convulsing to vomit, he just choked on it.  Gilkey.  The paper pusher shrugged off the guise of being an echo, closing the distance, getting shot once, before stabbing another of Maricica’s people, a woman, with the letter opener they’d presumably used to stab the first one.  Others started forward, and hunters stepped out of hiding or out over rooftops that were more echo than actual, letting their arrows fly.  Some were shot multiple times.  Nobody from that group came out unscathed.  ', 'We should consider the implications.”  “One of us has a brain in their head,” Thea said.  “I was driving at that.”  Gilkey dipped his head in a nod.

A shadow standing in the window of a vacant apartment, he watched.  His finger touched the base of the old windowframe and oozed out, and an ear formed in the ooze.  She was with a friend, who wore her hair in locs, with a black wool jacket that was heavier than the weather required, and a bag that was similarly massive, making her look smaller than she was.  ', 'The man was gone, and Gilkey had been born from that, an eroded Self at his core that had no real attachment to the man, aside from the fact that the man’s last moments had been some of Gilkey’s first.  Gilkey remembered the grief, the desperate setup of the wards before his brain had turned into gelatin in his skull.  Wards to keep people away and keep the poison contained.  Now things had settled.  The house would be death to anyone who entered, but the poison wasn’t likely to proliferate.  ', 'But she applied, she does good work.  I pay.  I help her on occasion.  Perhaps she’ll earn enough to find a way.  So long as you survive, all things are possible.”  “You offered this information expecting something more than a gift,” Gilkey told the Vendor.  “Did you want a certain result?  Removing her to… avert some disaster?  Helping you to survive?”  “Do what you will.  If you destroy her, it’s some currency with the people she’s left so devastated in her wake.”  “Could I destroy her?  Are there guards here?  ', 'She didn’t move like the dog had, except to draw in tighter, chest at the child’s back, legs curled under the child’s rear end.  Her neck was injured, the gelatin mottled.  In his first hours of existence, Gilkey had thought they were alive like he was.  He’d brought-  He saw it.  The shelf, lying on the ground.  Handprints marked where he’d held it with the poison still fresh and fierce in his system.  He’d brought down over and over again.  Now he knew they were only animated here and there by echoes.  He left them behind.  ', 'Gilkey wanted to hear the conversation they had after this meeting, but Odis would be too careful about that.  A part of him wanted that kind of dynamic.  No, wanting was the wrong word.  He yearned for it, as if it was something he’d had but lost.  Except he’d never had it that he could remember.  “If you have dangerous captives, I’d think you’d pay more mind to them,” Tomas remarked, tone conversational.  “You learned under Odis.”  It was Odis who replied.  ', 'In their hubris, they’d been more prone to destroying themselves and each other.  Sabotage became a kind of cold war.  Most fell, others withdrew or fled the area, and too many scattered, ill-fated projects and mistakes were left in the area.  Gilkey didn’t know if the man he’d been had been dosed with a vicious poison by a rival, then come here, where he hoped to counter the poisoning, where he knew there were wards.  If he had, that had been a terrible mistake.  The wards hadn’t held.  Perhaps he’d tried to make a poison.  ', 'Gilkey, are you an assassin?  Or a fighter?”  “No.  I watch, I bring messages.”  “Can I… help with that?” Avery asked the Lord.  “I’ve done a lot of surveillance, I’ve protected a perimeter, I have the tools, I’m fast, I can run messages.  Not- I’m not trying to take your spot, Gilkey.”  “It’s fine.  But I’m an Other, Avery Kelly.”  “I’m okay getting the same responsibilities.  I’m not trying to grow a practitioner family or anything.  ', 'It landed on the chair with a clatter, and the startled Typetap Kitty darted away, slipping beneath the bookshelves, with only a credit card’s thickness of space beneath.  Yellow eyes peered out from beneath, two dimensional and flat against the floor.  Abraham Musser approached, and the Typetap Kitty watched as his eyes started glowing.  It retreated.  To avoid being seen, it did a circuit around the apartment.  Once it had been one of Basil Winters favored summonings.  It had learned tricks, learned what to watch for.  Basil was gone.  ', 'He was crapping out the same bloody slurry.  He collapsed, and instead of convulsing to vomit, he just choked on it.  Gilkey.  The paper pusher shrugged off the guise of being an echo, closing the distance, getting shot once, before stabbing another of Maricica’s people, a woman, with the letter opener they’d presumably used to stab the first one.  Others started forward, and hunters stepped out of hiding or out over rooftops that were more echo than actual, letting their arrows fly.  Some were shot multiple times.  Nobody from that group came out unscathed.  ', 'We should consider the implications.”  “One of us has a brain in their head,” Thea said.  “I was driving at that.”  Gilkey dipped his head in a nod.

It defied easy explanation.  A crimson orb with glowing gold slashes in it for the eyes, a tiny slash for the mouth, and ornate painting around the slashes for ‘eyeshadow’ and lip definition was inset into a massive, hard growth of carved black stone, that formed about ten horns and spikes that could’ve been carved to resemble long hair.  Two thin black arms extended from that beard.  That was just the ‘head’, and that body part alone looked the size of a typical car.

Liberty went to take a picture, but Avery was already moving toward her, grabbing her wrist.  “Get in!”  “Let me snap a few pictures!  One good one!

Her mother started to stand, then froze.  “Stay still,” Avery said.  She moved her head around, looking.  ', 'Snowdrop waved.  And there was an Other that didn’t look like it belonged to the Paths.  It defied easy explanation.  A crimson orb with glowing gold slashes in it for the eyes, a tiny slash for the mouth, and ornate painting around the slashes for ‘eyeshadow’ and lip definition was inset into a massive, hard growth of carved black stone, that formed about ten horns and spikes that could’ve been carved to resemble long hair.  Two thin black arms extended from that beard.  That was just the ‘head’, and that body part alone looked the size of a typical car.  ', 'Snowdrop was wearing something that combined a dark gray high-fashion top with a massive hood, a silver-print opossum on the back and sleeve, mirroring Avery’s deer, with a long skirt that went out at the ankle, that had a thick band at the knee to mid-calf, where the black fabric was interrupted by a tapestry-like display silver-etched trash cans, broken televisions, scattered, half-eaten food, and trash bags.  Liberty went to take a picture, but Avery was already moving toward her, grabbing her wrist.  “Get in!”  “Let me snap a few pictures!  One good one!  ', 'In Snowdrop’s night vision, because of the range of colors opossums could see, her freckles stood out against her skin the same way blue ink might against white skin, the edges of the temporary tattoo on her arm were visible when they weren’t normally, and she could see some of the hints of the brush strokes in the paint on the wall from when walls had been painted, especially around the ceiling, vents, doors, and a few points where damage to the walls had been fixed and repainted.  Squeaksqueak.  Squeak.  ', 'Snowdrop became more spirit than anything, slightly blue-tinted, wispy at the edges.  She became an opossum and perched on Avery’s shoulder, eerily light compared to her usual dense mass.  Like they’d moved to a high place, but the view to the south was of Lake Superior, and that view curved upward, and it became possible to see the lake at the horizon… and where lake became sky was hard to make out.  Bowdler Hill to the east and Greensey to the west loomed upward, curving in like horns.  ', 'Snowdrop went small, and Avery handed her to her mother.  Inside were rows of counters, tables, and troughs of herbs and plants.  It was warm, too.  And Avery could see Fernanda, two women who could’ve both been Fernanda’s relatives, twentyish and thirtyish, a young woman with black hair and what looked like broken glass earrings and necklace, and an older woman who looked similar but wasn’t wearing the same.  Raquel Musser stood there, arms folded, looking anxious.  “You made it,” Fernanda said.  “Heya,” Avery greeted her.

He’d warded the area, and hid himself away, embracing the jar to seal it within his grasp.

The odor of brain, or whatever it was she’d thought was the odor of brain.  Why- why did this always come up when she wanted to ask?  She pushed past it.  “John,” she said, quiet and insistent.  “Couldn’t you take another path?  Couldn’t you… please wait?  Become my familiar.  That takes priority, doesn’t it?  I can give you… I hope it’s seventy or eighty years by my side.  ', 'The moment he suggested a stance, or looked as though he might withhold that kind of power from certain groups while supporting others, the balance was shattered.  He could play kingmaker if he chose.  It didn’t matter that Raymond had little interest in such.  It mattered that he could.  Alexander would destroy the man, by suggesting impropriety to the right ears.  He dialed.  The line clicked.  There was only a heavy silence on the other end.  No buzz or static in the line, no disruptions in the signal.  Nothing.  As if the phone was off.  “Alexander Belanger,” he announced himself.

', 'Alexander could See through that too.  “It might take a nudge to get them to look at you, but it might not.  The powers that be over there are different from the ones here.  Just like how the people who condemned you in the Maritimes aren’t the same ones that hold sway here.  With my finger hovering over this message, ready to send a text, you stand on a precipice.  Will you risk doing it again?  Or condemning someone else to it?”  Something slight in Ted changed.  How many thousands or tens of thousands of years had he lived?  ', 'There was only one recognizable last name from her time at the Blue Heron.  But two of them had links.  Milo was a specialist from a lesser family of war mages, the Songetays, and had married one of her old classmates’ older sisters.  Angie Demarest had almost been Angie Whitt.  She would have married Chase Whitt if Chase hadn’t ended up getting apprenticed to Alexander.  Elizabeth had little liking or admiration for Chase.  She was still glad he’d managed to dodge this bullet.  ', 'Alexander Belanger addressed the crowd.  “Thank you for coming.  I know it’s a long trip for some, and a dangerous trip for others.  The Blue Heron Institute holds a special place in my heart and that wouldn’t be possible without your attendance.  ', 'Nicolette said- that maybe it couldn’t be transferred to Alexander.”  “You’d think that with everything on the line, you’d find better.”  “She had better, I just- my mind’s a blank.  I’m cold.  And I’m not sure I deserve better.  A part of me is hoping you’ll say no and leave me to die.”  “I see that part very clearly, with all my senses.  Yet you’re here,” the Carmine Exile said.  The Carmine Exile seated himself in snow that was now so thick with blood that Seth’s hand was coated when he lifted it up and away.

She sighed.  “We’re going down past the bend where it’s private.  Laila and some boys are already there or on their way there.  There should be no swimsuits except those we were born with.  Do you need more information on that front?”  “Which boys?”  She sighed again.  “Beau, Easton, Howie, and Myles.

Made it harder to leave, but Lucy had others to check in with.  And coordinating to do.  She’d cheated the system to get the permission for the concert.  And for stalls.  Some were already setting up.  “I’ll be back,” she said.  She went, stopping at a few of the stalls on the way.  Innocent-friendly goods.  But unique things all the same.  She saw the St. Victor’s practitioners.  Kira-Lynn, Stefan, Adrian, and Nomi.

I want to do something like that again.  But with more girls.”  Fernanda raised an eyebrow.  “I mean, to balance out the numbers.”  “It’s good if there’s more boys.  If the numbers are too balanced, they’d want to pair off.  If there’s more of them, they compete for attention and affections.”  “Huh.  Yeah.  ', '“Want to hang?” Liberty asked.  Avery glanced at Liberty, and she really couldn’t read Liberty’s expression.  As for Nora, Nora’s eyes widened.  She looked both ways, at each of them.  “I don’t know?”  “Help her decide,” Liberty told Avery.  Avery stepped up, “Hmmm… I think we’re just hanging around and talking.  Maybe walking around some.  We’re going to sit on the patio, and not let my mom see the opossum that snuck up there.”  “Snowdrop?” Nora asked, smiling a bit.  “Yeah.  Anyway, if you’re up for it, it’d be great.  You could stay for dinner,” Avery said.  “Then patio after.

A lot better.  I guess she, uh, found herself?  She said she broke up with her old best friend, who lived out of town, and she found you and some other person?”  “Lucy.  Yeah.”  “Friends?  Best friends?  Or-?”  “Best friends.  Tough though, with her moving.”  “That’s so weird.

Then he nodded.  “If there are many things you wish to ask, I’d say start with the most important, whatever comes to mind first.”  “Verona and Avery.”  “It’s a good start.”  “I want to have Avery over later, when she’s done hanging out with Zed, Brie, and Jessica.

She sighed.  “We’re going down past the bend where it’s private.  Laila and some boys are already there or on their way there.  There should be no swimsuits except those we were born with.  Do you need more information on that front?”  “Which boys?”  She sighed again.  “Beau, Easton, Howie, and Myles.  ', 'I think she’d do better one-on-one with you than with Rowan, Sheridan and me at the table.  That’d be a weird scene.”  “Okay.  Though you’re not kids anymore, you know.  You’re turning into little adults.  I’ll think it over, see what she’s comfortable with.  It’d be nice to make a friend, if I’ll be here for the next two years.”  “Mm.”  “And you should be just about ready to go, right?  It’s about time?”  “Yeah.”  “Love that top.  Very cute,” her mom said, flicking the hood.  I wanted to be cool, not cute, Avery thought, slightly annoyed.  ', 'Which was fair, considering it was a dry heat right now, and it felt twice as hot since they’d been inside.  Avery’s skin prickled, and she closed her eyes for a second, thinking about a hard swim.  It would be so nice.  Except for the Fernanda part.  “You’re into it,” Verona whispered, bumping her shoulder into Avery’s arm.  “What?”  “Fernanda?  Really?”  “No,” Avery said.  “A swim would be great though.”  “A swim with Fernanda.  I thought Lucy was giving you a hard time about your taste in girls-”  “Well, like, Avery’s big, older crush,” Lucy protested.

Avery jogged with to maintain the conversation.  “Isn’t it better if we say something so it can be fixed?”  “This isn’t social time, ladies!”  “Not when the obvious fix is canceling the team, suspending him for a while or replacing him.

Made it harder to leave, but Lucy had others to check in with.  And coordinating to do.  She’d cheated the system to get the permission for the concert.  And for stalls.  Some were already setting up.  “I’ll be back,” she said.  She went, stopping at a few of the stalls on the way.  Innocent-friendly goods.  But unique things all the same.  She saw the St. Victor’s practitioners.  Kira-Lynn, Stefan, Adrian, and Nomi.  ', 'And they’re nice-ish, or I thought they were.”  “You couldn’t at least call someone else to come?”  “I didn’t know who you’d be cool with.”  Fernanda sighed.  “It was fun.  I want to do something like that again.  But with more girls.”  Fernanda raised an eyebrow.  “I mean, to balance out the numbers.”  “It’s good if there’s more boys.  If the numbers are too balanced, they’d want to pair off.  If there’s more of them, they compete for attention and affections.”  “Huh.  Yeah.  ', '“Want to hang?” Liberty asked.  Avery glanced at Liberty, and she really couldn’t read Liberty’s expression.  As for Nora, Nora’s eyes widened.  She looked both ways, at each of them.  “I don’t know?”  “Help her decide,” Liberty told Avery.  Avery stepped up, “Hmmm… I think we’re just hanging around and talking.  Maybe walking around some.  We’re going to sit on the patio, and not let my mom see the opossum that snuck up there.”  “Snowdrop?” Nora asked, smiling a bit.  “Yeah.  Anyway, if you’re up for it, it’d be great.  You could stay for dinner,” Avery said.  “Then patio after.

', 'They’d had the one group member who was nice to a girl and got kicked out of the quartet, and Declans Two and Three had been caught checking out porn on Declan Two’s computer after not clearing the internet history.  Declan had been teased a lot about his friendship with Amber for a while now, and apparently dropped her as summer started.  Sucked.  Amber and Cal were decent, as far as Declan’s friends went, and Avery was left hoping it was a phase and not a long-term thing.  With luck he’d probably regret it in a couple of years.

She’d gone once and didn’t feel eager to go again.  It wasn’t what she wanted or needed.  She wanted the one-on-one time with Ms. Hardy, but she did understand what Ms. Hardy had said about the boundaries teachers had to maintain with students.  That didn’t mean it didn’t suck butt.

Though I’m sorta starting to guess.”  Nora fidgeted.  “What’s going on?”  🟂  Nora  The pair of them watched Avery hurry across the street to grab the cheesecake.  “She can be such a blockhead,” Liberty said.

She’s cool and she’s super on my wavelength in a similar way to how you’re on my wavelength so keep an eye out for her.  I think she gets lonely so keep her company.  ', 'Avery took the harder route, around the head of the table, hugging her grandfather and getting the money from her dad before finding her way around.  Sheridan backed her chair up an inch or two to get in Avery’s way.  “You’re more childish than some of the actual children at the table,” Lucy said.  “And you’re a jerk.”  “Not so much of a jerk right now as I am a bad influence,” Lucy said.  “What?” Sheridan asked.  Lucy discreetly pointed toward the pitcher of water with ice cubes.  She saw Avery’s look of recognition, then a look of internal debate.  ', 'Avery sat with her chair near the wall, facing Jeanine.  Which, like… Jeanine was nice to look at, hit all the marks.  Jeanine was interested.  She drew on Snowdrop energy and checkmarks to keep from getting flustered, sorting out her bag, getting a notebook and pen out.  The guy looked agitated, Jeanine was distracted looking around the class, and the girl in the back corner looked ready to fall asleep.  “Two people per group, one to the front left corner, one to the front right!” the teacher announced.  “Separate packets.  Do not open the folders.”  “Mrs. ', 'Avery did great at basketball during gym.  Mr. Lai’s class got twice as bearable ever since we found out he was a secret lumberjack-carpenter, and Ms. Hardy’s class is fun because a student I know has a crush on her, and it’s funny.”  “Hm.”  “I’m still paying attention.  It’s just easier if there’s… more going on, I guess?  Sometimes.  There’s this app thing going around at school.  Popularity thing, kind of.  A lot of kids were pretty unhappy about it.  Lucy and Avery were among them.  ', 'Avery wasn’t really sure why they were together, when Laurie seemed really cool, nice, and pretty, with a lot of interests and passions.  When they spent a lot of time together they got snippy with one another, and when they were apart, it was like Rowan didn’t even miss her that much.  Declan’s Gamecouch page was more active.  It looked like Amber, their neighbor from three houses down and Declan’s friend from early childhood, had been ghosted by Declan.
