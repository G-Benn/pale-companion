      " 'documents': [<Document: {'content': '    The three of them stood in the main room of the basement.  Snowdrop had gone upstairs to keep an eye on Matthew and keep an ear out for trouble, while John sat on the stairs, peering out the basement window.  Edith had moved back and sat on one of the cushy, squat chairs, lounging and tense at the same time, eyes burning dull orange.  Tashlit stood with her back to the wall, not far from Edith, and the Sable Prince stood opposite Tashlit.  It was like a fence stretched between them, hemming Edith in.  Lucy watched as Verona put the syringe on the top of a squat bookcase and let go of it.  It turned slowly to point to Edith, the darkness inside moving.  It looked at first as if it might be from the cooling wind rune that Verona had put inside her clothing, to compensate for the longer-sleeved clothing and pants they wore.  “Why do this?” Lucy asked.  Edith didn’t respond.  Lucy studied Edith’s expression, but it was hard to read.  One of Edith’s hands clenched briefly, as if she was unconsciously reacting to a thought, then it relaxed.  “Is the Doom dangerous to you?”  No response.  No clench, no wavering in eye contact.  “Is it your intention to force us to bind you to get answers?”  Edith looked up.  “You’ve destroyed my marriage.”  “That’s a distraction,” Lucy said.  “Answer my question.”  Avery looked up, then walked over to be next to Lucy.  “Didn’t you destroy your own marriage, with any lies you told, or whatever you were doing with the Doom?”  “All we had to do was show him a syringe,” Verona said.  “Which you lost.”  Edith kept her mouth shut, fuming.  Lucy could have pressed her on that, to see if they could get her to break, but it still felt like they’d be going down the wrong path.  There was clearly something screwed up here, and as Lucy stared down Edith, arms folded, it was hard not to think of every bit of awfulness that had spilled forth from this.  The Hungry Choir was the big one, unconfirmed, and then the chaos, the breaking perimeter, the invading Others, people getting hurt and scared.  They never would have awoken, and without them awakening and being thrust into things, maybe the attack at the end-of-school party could have been averted, or the Belanger involvement, Alexander and Bristow dying or something equivalent to dying…  So much pettiness for… what?  She could have asked but Edith wasn’t answering.  Lucy turned and walked away.  Out of the main room, to the staircase.  “Everything okay?” John asked.  “Frustrated,” Lucy said.  Avery and Verona followed her into the room, glancing back at Edith.  “Where we at?” Verona asked.  “Thinking.”  “We could use the circle we whipped up,” Verona said.  “We should also do the basement, to keep her in bounds, and as a secondary measure.  We’ll have to figure out how to compel the other local Others into not breaking her out, if we’re keeping her prisoner long-term.”  “Or we could move her,” Avery said.  “Might be nicer to Matthew.  Gives him his basement back, means his wife who betrayed him might not be sticking around…”  “I can think of only one good place to stick her and nah,” Verona said.  “That’s a whole can of worms.”  The House at Half Street?  Yeah, stowing a perpetrator at the same location could go really wrong.  All it would take would be one point of failure.  All of this practice stuff forced its awkward analogies.  In that case, it was like imprisoning a criminal in a jail with the weapons they were trying to steal.  “John?” Lucy asked.  “Yes?” he replied.  His eyes moved to her, studying her, before going back out the window.  Confirming she wasn’t holding something or taking a snapshot of her expression before returning to the task at hand: keeping watch.  “You’ve been bound before?”  “I have.  Confined temporarily, not bound to anyone or anything, not compelled.  I saw many other Dogs of War be confined and compelled.  When we were trying to find our way overseas, the same families and groups that were trying to bind us sent some bound Dogs after us.”  “Do you have any thoughts on us binding Edith?”  “And compelling her?” Verona jumped in.  “Since you’re making that distinction?”  “It should be a last-ditch effort.  Have you exhausted every other measure?”  “I’m not sure what other measures there are,” Lucy admitted.  “She won’t talk.”  “Then you have to decide if you’re fine with not getting answers.”  Avery leaned into the stairs and under the railing to look upstairs, before leaning back to a regular standing position and asking, “Would you think less of us if we did this?”  “I would think of you differently.”  “Differently how?”  “In the same way I would see a young man who’d shot an enemy in a new light.”  “We compelled McKay.  Is that not… metaphorically shooting the gun?” Avery asked.  “I don’t know about the others, but I saw it as less violent than a shooting.  Field surgery requires deep cuts, and without some form of attention on that front, he was a dangerous individual.  You did what you did to reach a point where you could safely release him.  He was dangerous and he needed to be forced to a new direction.  But you wouldn’t be releasing Edith, would you?”  “Not…” Lucy started.  Not what?  Not… immediately?  Snowdrop poked her head downstairs, then made her way down.  John leaned out of the way to make room, but Snowdrop slipped under the railing and hopped down from the stairs.  “Update?” Avery asked.  “He’s doing just fine, he’s going to blab about what’s going on.  He liked having my company, my words were really reassuring, I think.”  “I’ll check on him,” Avery said, grabbing the railing, sticking a foot up on a fourth or fifth step, and swinging herself up, before heading upstairs.  “What’s he doing?” Verona asked.  “He’s going to drink all night.  Hasn’t gotten around to putting a drink in his hand yet.  Staying inside, not looking out into the distance.  He had a lot to get off his chest in terms of talking.”  “Right,” Verona said.  “Tashlit?”  Tashlit crossed the room where she was watching Edith, and leaned against the entryway to the main basement.  “You ever been bound?”  Tashlit made a so-so gesture and then shrugged one shoulder.  “How’s that?” Verona asked.  Tashlit looked around, then grabbed loose skin and twisted it, wringing it until it was wound taut between her elbow and her hand.  “Rope?  You were tied up?”  Tashlit nodded.  She made a cradling gesture and then held up five fingers, then grabbed the middle finger.  “Her sibling tied her up.  Was this the skinless crime lord dude?”  Tashlit nodded.  “But not like, practitioner binding, no compelling?  You’ve managed to avoid all that, with all the travel?”  Tashlit shook her head.  “Good for you,” John said.  “Doesn’t really count if it’s rope.  Any thoughts, any strong feelings?  Binding Edith?”  Tashlit moved her face-skin, smushing it around, then pulled on her lower eyelids, dragging them down.  “That’s a level one uneasiness.  Cool, right, thanks.”  Tashlit nodded.  “You two are even more incomprehensible now that you’ve spent enough time together to work out a system.”  Avery reappeared at the top of the stairs.  “He’s sitting on the porch in the dark, has a drink in hand, doesn’t want to talk.  Says he’s drinking the one and won’t have any more.  Also, Snowdrop’s backwards talking while trying to reassure didn’t go so hot.”  Snowdrop sighed.  “I didn’t really try that hard.”  “It was good of you to try,” Avery said.  “Bad call on my part.  I thought it’d be easier than one of us going, and we need John to stand watch.”  “At least I’m holding up my end of the familiar partnership.”  “Don’t stress about it, Snow.”  Lucy paced a bit, then walked back into the main room.  She considered how to phrase what she needed to phrase.  She looked over at the Sable Prince.  “These things proceed much more smoothly if you have a plan in mind and execute it.  Particularly when I’m involved.”  “May-” Lucy started.  She stopped herself.  The Sable Prince liked definitive language, firm phrasings.  Lucy picked her words more carefully, no maybes.  “My instincts are that you’re right, these things do go smoothly if they’re straightforward, standalone events.  But doing these things in too straightforward a way without taking new facts into account can cause a lot of problems later on.”  “It can.  At the same time, I must take note of the uncertainty.”  “Aren’t you supposed to be the direct one, Lucy?” Edith asked.  “Bringing two knives to your awakening?  Fangs, fierceness?  You’re practically pacing, leaving here to go to the stairs, asking questions, coming back.  You don’t really believe in this, do you?”  “You wronged us, Edith,” Lucy said.  “You wronged your husband.”  “For certain meanings of wrong, maybe.  Be careful with your words,” Edith said, voice low, eyes burning brighter.  “Edith,” Avery said.  “I got the vibe you liked us.  We had nice barbecue dinners here.  Now you’re so adversarial.”  “I liked you just fine.  I don’t like what you are and what you’re becoming.”  “We’re going out of our ways to try and avoid becoming the bad sort of practitioner,” Lucy said.  “No, you went out of your way, to the Blue Heron Institute, to train to become good practitioners.  You’re naturally inclined to practice in your own ways, you’re intelligent, and you’re driven.  You cooperate, and that puts you in close proximity to Alexander Belanger’s group, from Charles’s time being active as a practitioner.”  “What are you even on about?” Lucy asked.  “That makes no sense to me.”  Lucy looked, checking with Avery, who shrugged, and then with Verona, who tilted her head.  “I don’t think Edith differentiates between a competent practitioner and an evil one,” Verona said.  “By the roads competence and power are obtained, for your kind?  No, not really,” Edith said.  “Binding us, tapping us and our realms for power.”  “Most of what we do is from lessons taught by you guys!” Lucy retorted.  “If you had other ideas you should have communicated it!”  “Until you left!  Until you decided that wasn’t enough, that you needed to be able to bind us.”  “To catch the Carmine’s killers,” Lucy told her.  “We never asked you to.  We asked you to investigate, even indicated you didn’t need to put a wholehearted effort into it.  You decided to take it on yourself to take things this far.  You decided you needed the tools to then carry out your self-imposed goal.  You started on the road to associating with dangerous people, learning things dangerous to me and those I care about.”  Lucy shook her head.  Verona looked over at the Sable.  “Does this bother you?  That she didn’t want us to investigate thoroughly?”  “Are you trying to bias me?”  “I’m trying to figure out where you stand.”  “This is devolving to pointless argument on intentions.  I’m here to arbitrate something clearly defined and I’ll keep to that role.  The question I wish to answer is this: was Edith James Wrong?  If she was, I’ll lend power to any binding, and I’ll strip her of much or all of her ability.  You’ve suggested you don’t wish to extinguish her.  When the time comes, I’ll double check and verify that, limiting what I take.”  Edith’s expression twisted, a scowl, a look down and away.  “Well, as far as figuring out if she’s wrong, I think we’re on track,” Lucy said.  “Make it a less convoluted one if you can,” the Sable Prince told them.  “Is there a time limit?” Verona asked.  Lucy elbowed her.  Don’t ask that in front of Edith.  Too late now.  “Everything has its time limit, even if that time is in the far future, when all has crumbled and gone dark, devoid of Man and Other.”  “Right, but you here, tonight?” Verona asked.  “In effect, yes.  I may be impatient with your approach, and I intend to see this through, but if you take too long then other things will demand your attention, and if this becomes secondary to your attention, then I will make it secondary to mine.  I can arbitrate from a distance, as is the case in most forswearing and oathbreaking.”  Edith might have help coming.  “Better hurry, you three,” Edith said.  “Bind me if you must, with no clear proof of wrongdoing, and let every scared Other in Kennet know who and what they’re dealing with.  Or don’t, hold off, pretend to be noble, and forego binding.  Tell the Sable Prince that you’ve wasted his time.”  “No clear proof aside from your husband,” Avery said.  “We may have different definitions of clear,” Edith said.  “He inferred.  It’s for me and him to handle, or not handle, as the case may be.  You showed him the syringe, that’s doing more than enough.”  Lucy shook her head.  She looked at the Sable Prince.  “How would this process go if we were Others, challenging another Other?  If she wasn’t answering?”  “Many details would be different.  Foremost among them, I wouldn’t have come in the first place.  I can arbitrate from a distance.”  “You’re that aware of things?” Verona asked.  “I can be.”  We’re in a bind.  We need to get a clear answer from her to solidify the core argument about whether she’s basically forsworn, but she won’t give a clear answer without being bound.  If we bind her, we possibly ruin relationships with the locals…  Lucy stared down at the ground, fingertips digging into her arm above the elbow.  “Lucy,” John said.  She looked back toward the stairs.  “I can advocate on your behalf.  You used the Judge, you offered fairness, you’ve invited her to take a gentler route than binding, there are suggestions that she’s playing games and evading.  Binding seems necessary whatever her answers are, and compulsion can be forgiven if gently used.”  “If you make her say specific words then the words are yours, not hers, as are any costs,” the Sable Prince said.  “Meaning if we made her tell a lie by having her repeat something…?” Verona asked.  “Yes.”  Lucy folded her arms, staring Edith down.  Emotions kept leaking out, crossing Edith’s face, before being pushed down.  Lucy was reminded of Verona.  Verona did that sometimes, except it was almost never anger.  Suppressing valid emotions, holding back.  No, the anger was something Lucy was more familiar with.  The deep loss of someone she loved… it mirrored something Avery had evidenced.  Except for Avery, it was that there wasn’t anyone to love.  She wanted to connect and she knew there were no valid partners in Kennet.  It was its own kind of heartbreak, quiet, matched to Edith’s.  If you wanted someone and couldn’t, or if you had that perfect someone and lost them.  Matthew ceasing to care and going upstairs had been the point Edith had started to crack, more emotions coming out, the little bursts of lost control.  “You clearly don’t want to be bound,” Lucy said.  She noted Tashlit, Verona, Avery, and Snowdrop approaching behind her.  “Tell me, if you were compelled, what would you say?”  “Doesn’t that defeat the point?” Edith asked.  “Defeating the point is my point,” Lucy told her.  “You don’t want to be bound, you don’t want to be compelled, well, sorry, the binding may end up having to happen but we can make it easier to put up with, and we can skip the compulsion if you’ll just open your mouth and say what you’re going to end up saying regardless.”  Edith shook her head, mouth shut.  “When we go upstairs, Matthew is liable to ask us what we found out.  His heart is in turmoil-”  “Matthew has nothing to do with your business with the Sable Prince.”  “Matthew has everything to do with you.  If you turn this into a struggle, if you make us hurt you on some fundamental level in order to get answers, that hurts him by proxy.”  “I don’t think we believe Matthew is involved by proxy,” Avery told the Sable Prince.  “Thoughts and beliefs are no real concern of mine.  If you’re certain, tell me, and it can matter.”  Avery opened her mouth to say something, but Verona held up two fingers, before looking at Edith.  Verona asked, “Was Matthew controlled in any way, to make him participate in the conspiracy to kill and skin the Carmine Beast?”  “How should I know?”  “If you don’t give us clear answers, we’ll have to bind him until we know more,” Lucy told her.  “Leave him be,” Edith told them.  “Help us to do that,” Lucy said.  “Because the alternative is-”  “You’re forcing my hand.”  “I’m trying to find a course that isn’t using a binding to force your hand in a more brutal way.”  “This is brutish enough,” Edith retorted.  “What do you see happening when or if we bind you?” Lucy asked.  Edith drew in a breath, then said, “I’d tell you I swore oaths to keep the names of the other conspirators from you.”  “You’re admitting you had a role.”  “You know I had a role.  You were at the cabin.  You contrived to blow me up with my own runes, carved into the door.  You presumably stole the furs.”  “Stole you say, like they belonged to you in the first place,” Lucy accused her.  “You stole them from the Carmine Beast when you skinned the corpse.”  “I prefer to say we rescued the furs,” Verona said.  “It’s a better word.”  “Okay, let me get us back on track,” Avery said.  “You swore to keep the names of the other conspirators from us.  If I start by asking you if Maricica was involved…”  “I’m not answering,” Edith said.  “To do otherwise would break my oath.”  “Can I ask if Snowdrop was involved?  Or Cherrypop?”  “Really?” Verona asked.  “Can I?” Avery asked.  “I won’t lead you to an answer by eliminating every possibility other than the true culprits, if that’s what you’re after,” Edith said.  Verona looked over to the Sable Prince, asking, “If she was bound to answer and couldn’t because of a conflicting oath, what would happen?”  “It would count against her.  You could push it, you could even compel her to give a true answer, in violation of her other oath, depending on your power and the other party.  It would destroy her, but you would have your answer.  One answer, extinguishing her as the price.”  “Don’t want to do that either,” Avery said.  “But if lives are on the line, we might have to,” Lucy said.  Avery shook her head.  “When did you swear this?” Lucy asked.  “Not to name them?”  “A clear answer could lead you to them.”  “How about an unclear one?  Before or after you swore oaths to us in our awakening?” Lucy asked.  Edith stared at her, mouth shut.  “We could tell Matthew you cooperated some, made it an easier process,” Avery told Edith.  “He asked us to tell him things if we think he can bear it and you fighting and struggling the entire time to an unpleasant binding where we’re forced to leave you imprisoned in his basement…”  “Enough,” Edith spat out the word, standing at the same time.  The sudden movement saw Tashlit lunge away from the wall, interjecting herself between Edith and them, hand out.  Edith looked between them.  “I don’t think the person or people who got you to swear it was doing you any favors,” Lucy told her.  Edith didn’t answer.  “Are they doing you any favors?” Verona asked.  “Did they promise to free you?  Do you still have a role to play?  Or is this it?  You in this basement while they carry on?”  “I can’t give you any indicators about who they are,” Edith said.  “Unless I’m willing to unravel myself to do it.”  But after Edith finished that statement, she glanced back toward the stairs.  She wasn’t looking at John.  That was the direction Matthew had gone.  “Th-” Avery started.  Lucy raised a hand, and Avery stopped.  A moment passed.  Edith sat down, and her hand went to her forehead, so that the forehead rested against the webbing between thumb and index finger, the flat of the hand blocking her view of them and their view of hers.  There was no indication that her eyes burned or that she was anything other than a woman, like that.  To be safe, Lucy used her Sight.  Edith looked much as she often did.  Blades pierced her body in various places, and the blades glowed with a white-hot heat, as if heated by something intense within.  Each blade handle had ribbons trailing from it, edges singed, and the ribbons wrapped around her.  Many were red, but they varied in color and texture, each rough portion of her body given over to a certain color and material.  Blue-purple near the head, a red with a gold band running through it at one arm and shoulder.  A deep, iridescent red for the ribbon around the body.  The complex spirit was still inside the body.  The blades at her hands were new.  Broken blades piercing her hands from the back, watercolor staining weeping out, darkening the bandages they touched to a near-black.  When she clenched her fist the staining got more intense.  “I swore it after your awakening.  Recently,” Edith told them.  Lucy blinked, returning her vision to normal.  “Then by the oaths sworn, you conspired to keep information from us,” Lucy said.  “And by doing so, wronged us.”  “Yes.”  “So noted,” the Sable Prince said, from the background.  The words had weight.  “On the first charge Edith James admits guilt.”  “Did you ever have any intention of bringing us to the same level of status and equality as the rest of the Kennet Others?” Avery asked.  “You asked for fairness and equality when you awoke.  I didn’t argue when Matthew said you would have a vote.  It was an afterthought, after you brought it up in your exchanges with him while at the Blue Heron, but it wasn’t an afterthought I fought against.”  Lucy pressed, “But did you intend to follow through?  You’ve indicated a prejudice against powerful practitioners, did you-”  “No I didn’t,” Edith interrupted.  “I hoped you’d die and simplify matters, or that one of you would and the other two would be distracted and diminished.  I plotted to be rid of you in a way that would maintain other Oaths.  We did discuss using the Carmine role to help that along, but not to forswear you three.”  “Something else?” Verona asked.  “Yes,” Edith said.  “I’m cooperating.  May I have a cigarette?  There are some on the kitchen counter.”  “I think that would be dangerous,” Avery said, quiet.  Verona added, “It would allow Cig to drop in, it would allow you access to heat and fire…”  Edith’s voice became a near-growl.  “I want a fucking smoke.  That’s all, no ulterior motives.  I’ll swear whatever necessary.”  Lucy looked over at the others.  “We could do up the binding.”  “So eager to get to that point, are you?” Edith asked, bitter.  “No.  Not eager,” Lucy told her.  “At this point I think we have to do something to imprison you and keep you from participating further in the conspiracy.”  “Bring the whole pack and I won’t be too difficult,” Edith said.  Avery looked back at Snowdrop, nodding.  Snowdrop ran off.  “For the outer binding prison, sealing the room, we might need to move her,” Verona said.  She got her sketchbook, and quickly sketched out a right angle, then made each of the two lines double lines with a casual ease.  Lucy wasn’t sure she’d drawn that straight a line without using a ruler once in her life.  Verona added a bunch of overlapping triangles stabbing inward from the corner, then added a branching set of perpendicular lines that penetrated into the right angle from there.  “It’d be a square like this.”  “Okay.  Looks right,” Lucy said.  She dug in her bag for chalk.  “I’ll expedite matters,” the Sable Prince said.  “At least once, you were wronged, an oath broken.  You seek to seal, not unravel.  You’ll have my aid in part.”  “What does that mean?” Lucy asked.  He motioned, hand out, to the chalk, then to the floor.  Verona found a corner.  “I want my cigarettes first,” Edith said.  Verona didn’t touch chalk to floor, and remained crouching.  Avery walked over to the other, and Lucy ventured past the sitting Edith to the corner of the basement farthest from where John sat.  Snowdrop returned, carrying the pack of cigarettes.  She handed them to Edith, who leaned over to take them, then leaned back.  Edith tapped one cigarette out.  “Light them after,” Lucy told her.  “I don’t want Cig popping in or we might have to bind him.”  “Fine.”  Lucy touched chalk to floor, and it sizzled, melting like crayon pressed to a hot pan.  She jumped, pulling away, and glanced at Edith.  But it wasn’t a trick on Edith’s part.  The chalk that had melted out extended out into lines, parallel to the bases of the walls.  It wasn’t hot, but solidified into a pattern like crystal inset into the floor, crackling like it was freezing.  “Hold the image in your mind,” the Sable Prince told them.  Lucy remembered Verona’s drawing and held the image in her mind, touching chalk to floor again.  The entire stick of chalk disappeared into floor, sizzling and crackling.  The diagram Verona had drawn unfolded on its own.  Once the chalk was gone, Lucy skipped out of the growing cage, glancing at Edith as Edith bent beneath an invisible weight, or cringed back from the growing lines that extended behind her chair.  The diagram became more elaborate than what Verona had drawn.  Extending up the wall.  A matching diagram appeared on the ceiling. More white lines traced through the air, connecting floor to ceiling where there was no wall to travel up.  They crackled, catching the air around them.  A square prison cell, containing two chairs and a futon that could be laid on, including a television set.  “We may have to move her later,” Avery said.  “The same diagram, drawn for her and her alone, will have the same effect, my power lent to it.”  Avery nodded.  “I request permission,” Edith said, with an ironic air, waving her cigarette around as she looked over and up at the Sable Prince.  “May I use elemental power to light this cigarette and the ones that follow?”  “With their permission.”  “For that and only that.  Set no fires, no tricks,” Lucy warned.  “No alarms, no distractions, no bad intentions, no self-destructive intentions-”  “Beyond what cigarettes are,” Avery said.  “Yeah.  So you can do it so long as you’re doing it while sitting, making yourself comfortable, and answering questions.”  “Nice one,” Verona said.  “Good coverage of terms and things.”  Edith sat back and put the cigarette in her mouth.  She touched a fingertip to it and it glowed.  She puffed, and exhaled smoke.  The smoke stopped at the barrier.  “Do as you will,” Edith said, sounding hollow, like some of the life in her had left with that breath of smoke.  “I’ve lost my husband and marriage, I don’t care anymore.”  “On point two,” Avery said, quiet.  “She’s in clear violation.  She never intended to be equal.  She undermined us.”  “I did,” Edith answered.  “Simple enough.”  “It is established.  On the second charge, Edith James admits involvement.”  “And harming us?” Lucy asked.  “You were to safeguard us and you didn’t.  When Chloe was aggressive and the Witch Hunter was on the offensive…”  “Hm?” Edith asked.  Her eyes burned with the same heat as the cigarette, cutting through the haze of smoke that she’d already established.  “Did you or did you not use your fire to encourage Chloe to rampage in my direction?”  “If I did, it was unconscious.  But I’ll freely admit I had a lot of unconscious urge to be rid of you three.”  “Unconscious urges don’t count as much,” Verona said.  “No,” the Sable Prince said.  “Not by the terms of your awakening.”  “Did you erase the diagram and let Chloe come straight at me, where I thought I’d be safe?  You argued with me about diagrams a bit before.”  “I did not.”  “Did you bring the ghouls or any of the new invitations into Kennet with the conscious intent of putting us in more danger, instead of pursuing your oath to protect us?” Lucy asked.  Edith shook her head, looking away.  “If you’re honest we can tell Matthew-”  “Enough about Matthew!” Edith raised her voice, sitting up straighter.  Tashlit stepped forward, and Edith leaned back, waving her off.  “Leave him out of this and I’ll answer your damn questions.  You already have me, my life is ruined and it may be as good as over.  Don’t rub my nose in the shit.”  “Did you intentionally bring in dangerous or complicated Others, like Chloe, to raise the chances that we’d be taken out of the picture?”  “No comment, but to get this over with, I can say I had no intention of following through on my oath to protect you, unless I was directly asked, like I was with the Witch Hunters.  I sat out on the incident with the Abyssal Beast and the body snatcher and doppleganger because I was hurt, but also because I hoped you’d be too off balance to fight back.  Verona was having a bad day, you were tired and distracted.  One or all of you dying on your own would’ve been the most convenient ending.”  “For you.”  “For me and any co-conspirators.”  “On the third charge, Edith James admits guilt,” the Sable Prince said.  “You have asked that she live so she may continue to provide information.  On three counts, she has Wronged you, and she now exists at your sufferance.”  Edith barely reacted, eyes unfocused and burning in the smoke haze.  Moisture appeared at the corner of her eye, and it sizzled from heat, part of it bouncing off, while the remainder clung to her eye and fizzled away with a faint line of white smoke, distinct from the gray of the cigarette smoke.  The Sable Prince went on, intoning, “You have asked that she be imprisoned, and the binding is thus set.  You may set it, add to it, alter it, revoke it and replace it as you wish.  If you wish to compel her, you need only to set the appropriate diagram in place.  I, my peers, and the immaterial forces of this region will support this in all respects.  We will lend strength to diagrams working against her and secure them against outside forces.   Her power is restricted to what she requires to maintain clarity as spirit, echo, and elemental within the body of Edith James, unless you request she be restored, permanently or temporarily, to her full power.  Should she leave this region, the powers that hold sway there may or may not align with us on this.  Be warned.”  “We hear the warning and I hope we remember to take it into account if we ever transport her elsewhere,” Lucy said.  “Do you feel powerful, girls?” Edith asked, voice dry and a touch contemptuous.  When she looked at them, her eyes were a bit red.  Lucy shook her head, digesting all of that, before she could even begin to find a response.  She looked at the others, and Avery was paying a lot of attention to Snowdrop.  Verona was very quiet and still.  “Not in this,” Lucy said.  “I feel responsible for you now, and a bit pissed I’m forced to take on that responsibility and do this.  It leaves doors open for better things.”  Lucy wondered if the Sable Prince would leave now, but he remained where he was.  “We should ask other questions,” Avery said.  “The three teenagers who went missing around the time the Aware showed up,” Lucy said.  “Were you in the car, transporting the furs?”  “Yes.”  “Were you driving?”  “I must warn you, if I answered I would be unraveled, and I would no longer exist, at your sufferance or otherwise.  I can’t lead you to co-conspirators.”  “How would that lead us to co-conspirators?” Avery asked.  “Edith can’t or doesn’t drive,” Verona suggested, “so if she says she was driving it suggests the co-conspirators in the car, if any, were people who were even less able to drive.  That rules out a few people.  If she says she was in the passenger seat…”  “There aren’t many Others in Kennet who can drive,” Lucy said.  “Barely any, it seems.”  “It being a crummy driver would explain them bailing on the car and the furs instead of driving away, after nearly hitting Clem,” Verona said.  “Are they alive?  The three teenagers who took it on themselves to pick up the furs and drive them out of town?” Lucy asked.  “No.”  “Are they a concern for us?” Verona asked.  “As revenants, echoes?”  “Ooh, didn’t even think of that,” Avery said.  “I don’t know.  If they are, it either wasn’t planned, or it was planned and I wasn’t included in that planning.”  “Would you be included in planning?” Lucy asked.  “Normally?”  “I think so.  Nothing prior to this has led me to think that would happen or be set as a trap.  If there’s a revenant or wraith then I’d guess it would appear back in reality with revenge against me and any co-conspirators in mind, a problem more meant for us than anything that could be aimed at you.”  “Where can we find the bodies?  Or can we find the bodies?”  “I warn you, I can’t answer either question without being unraveled.”  “How?” Verona asked.  “If I answered that question I could be unraveled…”  “Ugh,” Verona said, making a face.  “If we found the bodies we could figure out the person who inflicted the lethal wounds?  If there’s no body, it could indicate they had an Other who could destroy all traces.  If there is a body, it narrows things down.”  “And the way they’d hide a body, like by using glamour or sinking it into the Warren-muds,” Avery said, not taking her eyes off Edith.  “Were you the woman in the mask at the time Yalda was turned into the Hungry Choir?”  Lucy asked.  “I must warn you, if I answered, I would be unraveled…”  “Right, yeah,” Lucy said.  She glanced back at John and saw him looking.  He turned away to look out the window again.  She paused as she considered that.  “That’s an odd answer, isn’t it?”  “I think it says a lot, honestly,” Verona said.  “It’s not meant to,” Edith said.  “Did you start to suspect me when we had the interview?  Or was it back at the cabin, you went looking for the furs and found them, despite my efforts?”  When you departed the Awakening by coin, Lucy thought, and we realized it was from the Hudson’s Bay Company.  They started as furriers.  None of them answered.  Edith seemed to not care much, because she leaned back in her seat, staring down at the cigarette she held.  It wasn’t Cig, Lucy could confirm.  Wrong type, no cut along the side, and it got shorter as she smoked.  “Did you have any part in the creation of the Hungry Choir?” Lucy asked.  “Yes, but even the Sable Prince had a part,” Edith answered, not looking at any of them, but staring into the smoke instead.  “Did he?”  “He was there when Yalda died.  She would normally rise again in her own time, drawing on the tether that connects her to the war.  He secured her death.”  Again, Lucy glanced back at John.  He hadn’t turned his head this time.  “I did,” the Sable Prince said.  “More specifically, did you help conceive the Hungry Choir, knowing what it might end up being?” Lucy asked.  “I must inform you that I cannot answer that without unraveling myself-”  “You specifically,” Lucy said, sharpening the tone of her voice.  “Your mentality, your motives.”  “I have to warn you that I cannot answer that without unraveling myself.  I will answer if you demand it but it will be the last answer I give you.  You have no control over my unraveling if I unravel because of an oath made to someone else.”  “This is bullshit,” Avery said.  “It’s great,” Snowdrop added.  “Is that because the Choir is itself a co-conspirator?” Verona asked.  “I cannot answer that-”  “Yeah yeah yeah,” Verona replied.  “Ugh.  That would explain some of the earlier answers, too.”  “Yeah,” Avery agreed.  “Both on the ugh and the explanation part.”  “Can we challenge that?” Lucy asked, turning to the Sable Prince.  “You may try.”  “I would say that the Hungry Choir is not a co-conspirator because it’s the murder weapon.  We established that reasoning and that way of talking about it at the time it was bound.  It had minimal volition, knew relatively little, and couldn’t be called a conspirator or ally.  They made it and set it loose.”  “You have called it the murder weapon before.  You questioned it and it knew almost nothing about the greater plots or plans.”  “Yeah,” Avery said.  “Edith?  Your counterargument?”  “I cannot make one because doing so would-”  “Enough.  You believe it but that does not make it so.  Allow me to verify,” he said.  He stepped across the lines of the diagram.  The smoke turned black, and the interior of the diagram that caged Edith went black with it.  “Uhhhh,” Avery said.  “I hoped to get more from this,” Lucy said.  “We’re on the right track,” Verona said.  “We should ask about the syringe after.  I’m curious how it works and what it does.”  “She won’t like that,” Avery said.  “I don’t like the murder of hundreds or thousands of people, but I’m sucking it up and trying to be fair, yeah?” Lucy asked.  She startled a bit, heart jumping, as the Sable Prince stepped out of the dark.  The shadows behind him followed him, disappearing into his suit with a crackle.  Edith stood in the corner, holding her cigarette by her side, not near her mouth, stiff.  “She had no defense, even with her word protected.  The Hungry Choir is more murder weapon than co-conspirator, and she admitted she has never considered it more than a tool.  Carry on.”  “What were we asking?” Lucy asked, quiet.  “Did she help make it?” Verona asked.  “Yeah.  That.  Edith?”  “I helped make it.  I cannot talk about how or with who or whom.”  “Why?” Lucy asked.  “Because of the oath I swore.”  “No, why did you do it?”  “For the favors I’d be owed when someone or something else became Carmine.”  “The Choir?” Avery asked.  “If I answered, that would lead you closer to the co-conspirators, and I’d be unraveled.”  “Didn’t we just handle this?” Lucy asked.  The Sable Prince shook his head.  “She’s not wrong.  A separate question.  Eliminating one concern does lead you closer.  The Hungry Choir wasn’t a co-conspirator but it was a candidate for the Carmine throne.”  “What favors?” Verona asked.  “The ability to bear a child safely.  Freedom from the Doom.  Securing Kennet against outsiders.  Not in that order, not all from the outset.”  “The Doom wasn’t wholly a manufactured threat, then?”  “We’re not talking about that,” Edith said, head dropping a bit, elbows on knees, eyes on ground.  Her free hand touched her forehead.  “What was the syringe for?”  “Not tonight,” Edith said.  “Ask another time, but not tonight.”  “It concerns Matthew.  If he’s a danger because he’s infected or controlled…” Lucy trailed off.  “Would you put him in a cell like this, right next to me?” Edith asked.  “To torment us both?”  “If Matthew needs to be restrained because he’s controlled, I wouldn’t inflict you on him,” Lucy told Edith.  “He doesn’t deserve that.”  Edith flinched at those words.  “Tell us,” Verona said.  “If we get it out of the way, there shouldn’t be a reason to bring it up past tonight.”  Edith stared down at the cigarette, then raised it to her mouth, drawing back until it was burnt to the filter.  She closed her hand around it, and heat glowed between her fingers.  She disposed of the ash that was left in the metal wastebin, then used her foot to push it in their direction before Lucy could say anything.  “Edith?”  Avery asked.  “I’m deciding what to say,” Edith snapped back.  “Okay.”  “Matthew found me the body of Edith James, he introduced us, snuck into the hospital, and let me in.  I told him I loved him, he said he couldn’t.  Too good a man to take someone he’d made and groomed as a lover, even if she was human now.  He made sure I was okay, checked in a few times, then disappeared.  I went to family for care and after I had some autonomy, I made some trips to Kennet to see Charles.”  “He was forsworn by then?”  “He was.  But he knows things.  I helped look after his affairs, it was hard for any of the other Others to do it when it required a measure of humanity to tackle the various little things.  It helped to take my mind off things.  While sorting things out and selling some of his practice things in exchange for favors, final things we needed for the perimeter, and for cash so we could pay for his food and accommodations, I found his address book.  Dramatis Personae, many practitioners have one such book.  I checked with a few people and by word of mouth I found an Alchemist.”  “The Leos family?”  “No.  A man from the master-apprentice line that made Jabber, as it happens.  I traded a piece of my old self for a syringe that I hoped would let me extract the negative emotions as a fluid I could then dispose of.  It’s something Matthew’s family would do, as heartless, cutting out or extracting the bad.”  “The Doom?”  Edith’s voice was hollow, her eyes more unfocused than ever.  The light that cut through the haze around her made her hair seem to glow like its own dull candleflame.  “My intention was to discard the heartbreak and resentment.  But my heartbreak and resentment is spiritual, out of reach.  Extracting Edith James’s Doom that had dogged her to attempt suicide did give me some relief, but when I disposed of it, it came back for me.  I had a scary moment, I thought of calling Matthew for help.  Around then, in a moment of weakness, I realized he’d come if I was the damsel in distress.”  “And you started feeding it?”  “I fed it when it was banished and weak, letting it come back.  It was easy to flirt with destruction when my life had no light in it so long as Matthew was gone.  Once we established that it would keep coming back, he decided to stay close.  I think a lot of men fantasize about being the hero to rescue the damsel in distress, don’t they?  I didn’t want to pressure him into romance.  Keeping him close and having him around was enough, but we did fall into romance in our own way, and I didn’t stop it.”  “And then you kept feeding it?”  “He bound it within himself.  Matthew grew in strength and ability to cope, winning the internal struggle against it, and at the same time, he pulled away from me.  Arguments about things that were petty and stupid in retrospect.  I panicked.  I strengthened the Doom he had inside him so he wouldn’t win that war.  I told myself I wouldn’t do it again.  It happened once in the span of two years.”  “Then you did it again?” Lucy asked.  “He grew as a person, his Self found strength.  We realized we couldn’t have children.  Because of the monster I’d made, because of what Matthew is, because of what I am.  He pulled away.  I panicked,” Edith said, sounding more like a robot than a spirit or human now, like she was reading aloud from a book she’d never opened before now, about someone fictional.  “And it didn’t take two years for the next shot?” Avery asked.  “No.  The syringe broke when we moved into this house.  I thought it was a good thing.  I had no intention of using it again.  So I traded for that thing on the table there.  I’d ask you not to give too much consideration to the design.  I won’t name who gave it to me, but more Others than you think will associate with the Fall courts where they engage in the most trade.”  “Sure,” Avery said.  “Even we did some shopping there.”  Lucy nudged Avery.  Don’t give away information.  “I didn’t um,” Avery replied.  Lucy pursed her lips.  “It came with terms.  That I cloud Matthew’s eyes and ears and burden him with distracting the Doom at key times.  I hated it more than anything, even more than being bound.  But I did it.  If I let myself become more Edith James the body, then the Doom stirs and Matthew struggles, and he misses details or gets distracted holding it all in.  That is the extent of the control.  He is not a meaningful danger to you.”  “Edith,” a male voice said.  Lucy turned.  John motioned at Tashlit for a moment, and Tashlit practically skipped in her hurry to go stand guard, letting John approach.  “I’m sorry to interrupt,” he said.  “I know you have limited time before things get more complicated.”  “It’s okay,” Lucy said.  “I wondered if you’d come over or want to ask.”  “I consider Matthew a friend,” John told Edith.  “So do I.  I consider him-”  “What you did was monstrous.  You changed the course of his life.  Daily discomfort, pain, and worries.”  “I thought I’d be done with this,” Edith said, standing, turning away.  “Look at me,” John said.  “You’ve broken bread with me, had drinks with me, you’ve asked me to guard this town and face down threats the rest of the Kennet Others couldn’t, you’ve asked me to console.  We’ve known each other for a decade.”  She looked at him.  His voice became something less stern, softer, with a broken quality to it.  “You couldn’t let Yalda rest in peace?  She agreed to die because she didn’t want to kill innocents.  She couldn’t exist without binding and rotting the guts of the innocents in the area, she had enough influence there was no getting far enough away, it was the only option.”  Edith turned her back to John.  “Did you ever think of me as a friend?”  “Yes,” Edith said.  “But when the gloves were thrown down, you were willing to soil that friendship and take what you wanted?  A chance at a baby shared by you and the man you were exploiting?”  “I didn’t see it as exploiting-” Edith started.  “A chance to set up a new Carmine, and get an audience, banish that Doom you’d created so you could stop worrying about being found out?”  “And securing Kennet.”  “In order for me to believe that was anything but a selfish thing, I’d have to believe you were capable of anything selfless.  Treating Matthew like you did?” John asked, voice hard.  “Me?”  “I was-”  “Yalda?” he asked, voice cracking with the intensity he uttered the word.  “I was born first from a pyromaniac, selfish, broken, desperate, I-”  “You were also born from vigil, remembrance, friendship, love.  And you seem to have let that part of you slip to irrelevance, Edith.  You didn’t seem to remember your friendship with me when you did what you did.  Did you forget love and caring in your relationship with Matthew?”  Edith glanced back over her shoulder.  Moisture sputtered at the edge of her eyelid, the eye dim.  “You’re made of such great, rich spirit and experience, enough for several people.” John said. “I’ve looked up to you in the past.  You could be so glorious in your spirit form.  So tell me, please, how did you become so small a person?”  “John,” she said.  “You could have let her rest in peace.”  The dark look in his eyes was far too close to what Lucy had first seen in him.  Had that been the case back then because he was meeting them?  Three of them, all young, all girls?  Like Yalda?  It was always there, a little, but it was so intense now.  Hurt just sitting there on and around the eyes, in everything about how the face was put together in that moment.  If the words weren’t enough, Lucy felt like the look was sufficient to shut Edith up.  He walked away, and Edith said nothing to his back.  He paused at the entryway to the stairwell.  He took a long moment just standing there, his back to all of them.  Tashlit looked at him, eyes blinking beneath that shroud of skin, as loose on parts of her as a toga on a torso.  Lucy thought about saying something, but words failed her.  She thought of Alexander, lying in the dirt, head cracked open like an eggshell, brains ruined, blood thick and congealed at the edges, more ooze than anything that could pour or run.  That was the opposite of what John was here in this moment and she couldn’t talk to the John here and now either.  He spoke.  “Girls.  I’m going to go talk to Matthew.  I’ll be outside.”  “Okay,” Avery said.  “You have Edith secured, you have Tashlit keeping watch?  You don’t need a second.”  “Yeah,” Lucy said, quiet.  “Go, look after him, look after yourself.”  John turned his head, looking at the Sable Prince.  Then he strode away, pausing only so Tashlit could squeeze to the side and let him up the upper portion of the flight of stairs.  Lucy watched the stairs for a bit, watched Tashlit stare out at the dark driveway.  She looked in the direction of the Sable Prince, who hadn’t yet left.  He met her eyes, and she glanced away.  Why was he still here?  Was there more left to resolve?  A final decision on Matthew?  “Want me to take point?” Verona asked.  “If you want.  My brain isn’t really in a position to take point,” Lucy replied.  “Figured,” Verona said.  She walked up a bit.  “You good?” Avery asked, quiet.  Lucy nodded.  She turned her attention to this whole business.  Edith still bound.  “Heya, Edith,” Verona said, voice artificially bright.  Edith didn’t reply.  She wiped at one eye and it sizzled dry.  She looked at Verona, eyes a bit red, expression glum.  “Can the rest of the questions wait?”  “What would you say the percentage chance is that you make it to tomorrow?” Verona asked.  “What?”  “Because of any pre-prepared tricks, traps, measures, you setting yourself up to burn up, ummm, outside forces?  Could any co-conspirators-”  “I have to inform you that if I remark on my co-conspirators-”  “Do you think that anyone would destroy you?  Have there been any hints?”  “No hints in that direction.  I think as long as I’m not in a position to name him, her, or them, whichever are true, they aren’t concerned.”  “So what’s the chance?”  “I don’t know.  If I had to guess, ninety-five percent.  I can’t account for you, I can’t account for random accident.  I’m not strong right now.”  “So we could leave this to tomorrow.  But I want to ask first… why the heck aren’t you guys freaking out more about the furs being gone?”  “The furs?”  “It’s been awfully quiet, apparently, you didn’t seem to be panicking, nobody’s acting erratic, there’s no signs that we derailed your plan by taking the furs, but they were important enough to take.”  “This can’t wait until tomorrow?”  “I’m curious now.”  “When you were ready to awaken, we told you we knew the power base of the Carmine Beast was still in Kennet.  We know that remains the case.”  “And?”  “That’s it.  It’s close enough to grasp.  I don’t know enough about that part of it to say how or why they would do the grasping.”  “But they’re confident?”  “If they aren’t, they’re hiding it from me as well as you.  I don’t think that reveals anything significant about the co-conspirators.”  “Okay,” Verona said, “so what would happen if we took the furs and bailed?”  “I don’t know.  I think you’d end up the same as the three teenagers.  Once they realized you were leaving, they would pull out all the stops.”  Verona nodded.  “Can I ask?” Avery asked, interjecting.  “Bit of a tangent.”  “Heck yeah, go for it,” Verona said.  Still artificially bright, as if to contrast the whole John episode.  “When did you blur Matthew’s vision and hearing?  Or tax him, or otherwise use the Doom and transition to being a bit more Edith?”  “I cannot list all the times because many would implicate certain individuals…”  “List some?” Avery asked.  “The meeting once you returned from the Blue Heron.  From Matthew’s perspective, he was tired, he had a few bad days and it made him more vulnerable to the Doom.  It put him on the back foot.  He let me set more policy, then he followed my lead and pushed for that policy when talking to you.  He and I both expected and hoped that you three would want to stand down or that you’d be struggling, after a difficult end to the time at the Blue Heron, Alexander dead, Bristow wishing he was dead.”  Verona’s smile faltered for a second.  “But you didn’t, and he and I charged forward with the discouragement of gifts, among other things.”  “And the next meeting?  Where we crashed it because we had the info about the Abyssal beast?  You wanted to get rid of us?”  “I couldn’t tell you who, out of concern for going against an Oath I’ve made, as established, the-”  There was a bang, a solid thud on the wall.  Lucy turned.  Tashlit.  Lights were on, shining on the driveway, making it bright.  Tashlit stood, rather than sit.  The five of them, Lucy, Verona, Avery, Snowdrop, and Tashlit, all hurried upstairs, Tashlit leading the way.  Tashlit looked in through the small, high window in the door, and then headed over toward the back door.  The window was hard to peer through, so even Lucy’s attempt, as the tallest of the three of them, didn’t do more than show her the top of someone’s head.  She followed Verona and Tashlit to the back door and back porch.  Matthew and John were still sitting, and the gate in the fence was open.  The Kennet Others entered.  “They caught wind,” Lucy noted.  Lis carrying a lit cigarette, Nibble with a crutch and a nub of a foot, Alpeana, Guilherme, Maricica, the four original Kennet goblins, with Jabber sitting on Bluntmunch’s shoulders, the rest of the surviving goblins from Tatty and Creamfilled’s gangs, Ken in three aspects with one carrying a Montague-tainted radio, the Composite Kid Reggie, and Crooked Rook.  “What’s happened now?” Toadswallow asked.  “The perimeter faltered,” Rook noted.  “Is it down?” John asked.  “No.  But it’s under siege.  It’s worse than it’s been,” Rook said.  “Did the practitioners do something?”  “Edith James is imprisoned for her role in the murder of the Carmine Beast,” Lucy announced.  There was a mumur.  “Confirmed?” Matthew asked.  “I told you it was,” John said.  “I want to hear it from them.”  “The matter,” a heavier voice announced, “is confirmed.  Know it to be truth.  It was handled in a just and fair way, with more mercy and a more measured hand than I would have shown.”  The Sable Prince stepped through the open glass door and the four of them parted to let him through, Avery leading Snowdrop back, Lucy and Verona stepping back the other way, Verona bumping into Tashlit.  “Just like that?” Toadswallow asked.  “It’s done.  She is imprisoned and I’ve had a hand in setting up that prison.  Until they forfeit her, she will remain within.  They may choose to move her or alter the terms of the imprisonment.”  Lucy could see the unease in the Others, even among Others she was pretty sure weren’t involved.  “We checked with the Judge before and after, we validated it, and we went out of our way to avoid compelling her,” Lucy told them.  “This is so,” the Sable Prince agreed.  This was the advantage in bringing him along.  Even the most savvy arguers in this group couldn’t really argue against a grand arbiter of right and wrong.  Lucy addressed them all.  “Edith James played her part in the creation of the Choir, she harmed friends for selfish reasons, and used too many of us as tools.  Us three, Matthew, sorry-”  “I’ll explain to them in my own time, if I can get to grips with it,” he told her.  “-Yalda, John, sorry again,” Lucy said, with a bit more emotion and meaning in her voice than when she’d apologized to Matthew.  Maybe that was unfair to Matthew.  “Okay, yeah.  Please do.  She violated the terms she agreed to when she awoke us, and she’s admitted to harming three teenage innocents.  We’ve imprisoned her in what I think is a humane way, we’ll make sure she has the basic minimums until we can figure out a longer-term plan for her care and imprisonment.  For your safety, ours, and Kennet’s.”  “I’ve lent my power to the binding,” the Sable Prince announced.  “Not only will attempts to free her fail in most circumstances, but they will incur a heavy karmic debt.”  “We can cover the rest later,” Verona said.  “That’s just to give you an overview.”  “This was deserved,” Avery said.  “Are you done?” Rook asked.  “Talking?  For the time being,” Verona answered.  “Then I’ll tell you right now, Edith was holding back some of the echoes and spirits around Kennet.  They’ll be a problem until she’s released.”  “We’re not planning on her release anytime soon,” Lucy told Rook, frowning.  “As the case may be, you’ve created a mess.  If you’ve said what you need to say, would you please go and start cleaning it up?  A patrol, while the rest of us find our feet.”  “One of our allegations against Edith was that we were being left out of important things.”  “Someone needs to patrol,” John said.  He stood.  “I will.”  “We need more than you,” Rook told John.  “And we’ll need to figure out our next steps.  Your counsel would be appreciated.”  “Among those steps,” Matthew said.  “I can’t lead Kennet anymore.  Not now, not like this, when I’m questioning almost everything.”  “We’ll hold a vote,” Crooked Rook said.  “Electing a new leader, then, and deciding how we respond to the spirits.  Practitioners-”  “We get a vote,” Lucy said.  “It was pledged to us.”  “It was,” Matthew said.  “Fine.  Name your choice of leader, then.”  “I’d rather be involved.”  “Someone can give you a summary, practitioners.  How else do you propose we deal with the new influx?”  “Toadswallow,” John said.  “Temporary, until we can figure out another option.  Now I’m going out on patrol.”  Lucy looked at the other two.  “Toadswallow,” Verona said.  “You,” Lucy told Crooked Rook.  Rook’s eyebrows, fine white hair on purple skin, went up.  “Rook,” Avery said.  “I’m offended, my dear!” Toadswallow cried.  “Your opossum has failed you in her extolling of the virtues of goblinkind and what we offer!”  “Faerie are better,” Snowdrop said.  Faerie.  Lucy looked over at the Faerie, and saw Maricica’s expression was unreadable.  Guilherme looked like his best self, but he hadn’t said or done much.  It breaks my heart in small ways to see you be so blunt when you have such potential for grace.  He’d said it twice, and the second time, it wasn’t said in a way like he was playing with words or making a joke.  “For that reason, I pick anyone but Toadswallow,” Snowdrop said.  Rook asked, “Would you go?  Patrol, help secure us against spirit?  John will struggle with the immaterial things Edith was holding back simply by holding a leadership seat.”  “You want to be rid of us that badly?” Verona asked.  “It makes a lot of things easier.”  “Come on,” Lucy said.  She glanced back at Matthew.  “Nobody goes down to Edith?  They need our permission first.”  “Except Matthew.  It’s his house, he might need to unload,” Avery said.  Lucy made a face.  “Maybe.  Talk to us first, Matthew?”  Matthew took a second, then nodded.  “As you wish it.  Conversation across the barrier will be impossible, vision clouded, no signals will pass through until the word is given.  Now, as you prepare to take your leave, I will take mine.  Announcing that this was just and right is my last step of direct involvement in the matter of Edith James, barring incident.”  So this is what he was sticking around for.  He was anticipating this mob.  “Thank you,” Avery told him.  “Will you take your leave now?” Rook asked, with a hint of impatience in her voice.  “Will you make our prompt departure our gift to you?” Lucy asked.  “In exchange for a favor?”  “What favor?”  “A meeting, a chance to talk, maybe a trinket or three.”  “If you insist.  But go now.  The spirits and strange echoes are already making their way past the perimeter.  One part of Ken is working on it, the rest will follow after you as soon as we’ve fixed what we could here.”  Lucy glanced around, then hurried on her way, running with Verona, Avery, and Snowdrop.  Tashlit remained behind, as did John.  Rook was supposed to be on their side.  They’d have to trust things to her, and hope that by skewing the vote to be Toadswallow against Rook, counting on Rook to have some sway over newcomers, and Faerie being unwilling to vote for a goblin, that she’d win.  If not, they’d make do with a crafty goblin in a time of war.  Her Sight made it clear that the statement from Rook wasn’t a lie.  Something had given way as they’d removed Edith from the power base of Kennet.  She could only hope that whoever was put in charge could replace that with something equivalent.  Watercolor staining, bright and luminescent, was bleeding in from the edges, sometimes bursting out to splatter the nearby area, other times a slow, gradual march that trailed rainbow colors behind.  Leaving Edith behind felt like leaving the Furs with Verona.  But they’d gotten Edith, and they had a starting point for more, whatever Edith had sworn.  The trick was that they would now have to juggle the fact that the Kennet Others knew.  That had been unavoidable.  Edith would be missed in any event.  She could see more lights and stains now.  She paused, checked nobody could see, then pulled off her top, leaving only the camisole she’d worn underneath.  The lines were drawn out in silver marker on her skin.  For the others, it was black marker.  There were marks on her arm she could touch together for shields and for a burst of water.  There were wards against echoes and spirits, specifically against Edith, but they’d help here.  “Easy peasy,” Snowdrop said, as she took in the influx.  It felt like standing on a mountain, watching the water level rise to swallow up the mountain from all sides.  Shark infested water, maybe.  Except Kennet was a valley and they came from the edges and the high ground.  And Kennet was dark, still a bit dark, after the Sable Prince, and the spirits and echoes came in all colors, shapes, and types.  “At least we prepared for a scrap, just in case,” Lucy said.  “This is going to be a long night,” Avery agreed.  A building that had gone dark when the Sable had arrived and turned its lights back on in the meantime, near the north of town, had all the lights go off at once.  A blackout that rolled to several adjacent buildings.  To Lucy’s Sight, it was some kind of spirit.  “Do you think, when she told Matthew to do nothing, she was thinking that this was coming?” Verona asked.  “One last bit of manipulation?  So he’d stand down in a time like this?”  ', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': 16.548688813538742, 'meta': {'arc_title': 'Dash to Pieces', 'pov': 'Lucy', 'wordcount': '10736', 'series_chapter_number': 107, 'arc_number': '11', 'extra_material': False, 'title': 'Dash to Pieces - 11.4', 'chapter': '11.4'}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '9d1d5be51f83bd238a4900ccc6cee6c4'}>,\n",
      "               <Document: {'content': '    The grass of Edith’s neighbor’s lawn turned black and hard, rustling, hard edges scraping against hard edges as the transition happened.  Each bit of grass became an actual spear or blade, and the grass was just long enough that each blade could point another direction, or be different lengths from its neighbors.  Edith remained where she was, as blades started to grow in length, surrounding her.  Her eyes burned orange, darting around, and her chest rose and fell as she breathed hard.  The blades stopped growing when they got an inch or so from her feet, ankles, calves, knees.  Many of the longest pointed toward her.  “What are you doing?” Avery asked the Sable Prince.  “Facilitating,” he answered.  He enunciated carefully but the ‘ing’ at the end of the word had a roughness to it, as if he had a sore throat but it only caught the end of the word.  It was quiet enough that she could catch it.  His following sentences were similar.  “If you would like me to do something else, you can ask.”  She didn’t know, so she didn’t ask.  “Edith,” Matthew said, quiet.  “Do nothing, Matthew,” Edith told him, turning.  “What’s going on?”  “Do nothing.  Hold off.”  “Shutting down Kennet like we did, holding the neighborhood still…” Lucy said, looking around.  “At rest,” the Sable Prince said.  “Is it hard?” Lucy asked.  “Does it cost something?”  “Some.  It was the easiest road forward for what you wanted to do.”  “Can we take this inside?” Lucy asked.  “And not pay that cost?”  “It is not only the house of Edith James, but it is the home of Matthew Moss.  It is their space.  Even if it were her space alone, she would get a chance to respond before everything that is hers is forfeit.”  Edith drew in a deep breath, the orange of her eyes trembling.  “Forfeit?”  “You’ve been indicted, your husband indicted by proxy.  A few words from your area’s practitioners would indict him as well.”  “Indicted?” Matthew asked.  He took in the scene in a new light, then shook his head.  “No, that’s too much, this is too much-”  “The situation is pretty serious and the stakes are pretty high, Matthew,” Lucy said.  “Are you going to cooperate?”  “Are you going to execute my wife on my neighbor’s lawn?  In my house?  This can’t be how it- no.”  “We don’t want to execute her,” Avery said.  “That’s part of why we’re doing it this way.  We went to the Judges to double check that our course of action was right and within our rights and the Sable Prince is supposed to help ensure this all goes smoothly, with as little fighting as possible.”  “We’d like to start with questions,” Verona interjected.  “Are you going to cooperate?” Lucy asked.  Matthew looked over at Edith.  “I don’t even know what cooperation entails.  But I won’t fight you.”  Edith nodded once.  “It should be a lot easier and more comfortable if we can do this inside,” Avery said.  It seemed like Matthew was so overwhelmed he was having trouble taking it all in.  “John?”  “I trust them,” John said.  “I don’t,” Edith added.  “You have your gun out,” Matthew said.  “One of my guns.”  “Can we go inside?” Lucy pressed.  “So the Sable isn’t wasting power keeping the coast clear?  That’s a cost that has a receipt, doesn’t it?”  “Yes,” the Sable Prince answered.  “Amortized by the flows of karmic right and responsibility.”  “I don’t know what that word means,” Lucy told him.  “I’ll rephrase.  It’s written off because it’s my job.  Because you seem to be in the right here.  If you’re not then it will fall on your shoulders.  If you are, then it will add more weight to what falls across hers.”  “Can we go inside?” Lucy asked, again, looking over in the direction of Matthew and Edith. “I think we need your permission.”  “It’s easier,” the Sable Prince said.  “Meaning we could trespass but it would muck things up?” Verona asked.  The Sable Prince nodded once.  “We should go inside, then,” Edith said.  “Matthew?”  “Yeah.  Okay, permission given.”  “Basement, please,” Lucy told Edith.  The blades of black stone grass receded.  Edith stepped forward hesitantly, and the blades that remained shattered and crumbled.  She crossed the lawn, walked through the black wood chips of her own ‘lawn’, and entered her house.  John followed immediately behind her, while Matthew stood to the side of the front steps.  Avery glanced at him as they joined the procession.  “You’ve drawn on yourselves,” Matthew commented, as Verona walked by.  Verona’s hooded top had a ‘v’ at the neck and dipped low enough that the drawing at her neck and collarbone was visible.  “In case things got violent,” Lucy answered.  “I don’t think I would have thought to do that when I was your age, or known what to draw.”  “I was at this for barely more than a week when I got stranded at the Forest Ribbon Trail,” Avery said, skipping up the steps and pausing at the railing before entering the front door.  “With everything that’s been going on we’ve had to learn fast.”  “We offered to let you scale back, do less.”  “Was that you or Edith who pushed that?” Lucy asked, from the front hall.  “I’m going to hold off on answering questions until I know more about what’s at stake here.”  “Alright,” Lucy said.  They entered the basement.  Edith turned on the lights, and Avery could see that the lines on the floor from McKay’s binding had been thoroughly cleaned away.  There were cleaning supplies piled up in the laundry room, just beside the door.  The room was square, but had a corner blocked off, an appliance humming within.  Furnace or water heater, maybe.  Dark wooden floorboards, with wine red walls.  Edith had planted herself in the far end, beside that humming, blocked off area.  A small television was in the corner, dusty and connected to a cable box, and some furniture that had once been arranged to face the screen had been moved and turned around to face the spot where McKay had been bound.  A few squat cabinets and shelves held books and a multitude of small candlesticks and jars with candles in them.  Some of the artwork was pretty normal, and might have been stuff Matthew had picked up, but there was also an arrangement of planks that looked like it had been scorched strategically, and a collection of wicker bristles and woven things arranged around branches, that looked like a star giving birth to baby witch’s brooms.  Avery found herself studying it in new light.  “Can we take that down?” Avery asked, pointing at the decoration.  “And put that aside?”  “Who are you asking?” Matthew asked.  “You.”  “I’m not about to set fire to my own house,” Edith said.  “Or my decor.”  “It gives me a bad feeling.  It’s very you,” Avery said.  “Claim,” Verona added.  “Could influence spiritual flows.”  “Well, that,” Avery said.  “But also I remember when we were protecting the perimeter against Aware, she liked surrounding herself with candles, papers, and things.”  “Trust your instincts,” Lucy said.  “Matthew?  Please.  The candles and candlesticks too.”  “Do whatever,” Edith said, sounding disgusted.  She stood surrounded by soft chairs and a futon, and she didn’t sit.  Matthew approached, went to put a hand on her shoulder, and she leaned away from the hand.  He remained there with hand still for a solid second, before he went to lift the wicker thing off the wall.  He got the wooden planks, four vertical, one horizontal, all black and burned, with a bit of a grunt.  Lucy and Avery grabbed candles and candlesticks while he did that, passing some extra to Snowdrop, who helped carry.  Everything went upstairs.  John, the Sable Prince, and Tashlit remained in the center of the room, blocking off Edith, who remained at the far end.  “Do you want me to release my hold on things?” the Sable asked.  “You implied it earlier.”  “What are the consequences of that?” Lucy asked.  “The residents of this area can go about their evenings again.  Whether they are neutral or enemies.”  “Okay,” Lucy said.  “John, Tashlit, can you guys do us a favor and keep an eye out?  Matthew, don’t let anyone in?  And if someone does come in because they don’t use doors, like Cig or Alpeana, don’t let them leave without us addressing it.”  “Windows,” Avery said, pointing.  “The goblins come in that way sometimes.”  John crossed the room, going to the window, and locked them.  “Is this a soft binding then?” Edith asked.  “Me held at bay by the threat of a gun and a judge?”  “For now,” Verona said.  “We’ll probably end up drawing something.  We thought you might fight, so we didn’t want to commit to anything.  If you cooperate, we were thinking we’d use all the available floor space.  Leave you room to move.”  “It depends on how open you are with answers and how dangerous we think you are, at the end of this,” Lucy said.  “And if Matthew is willing to agree to swear not to interfere or release you.  And other things.”  “And if I’m not?” Matthew asked.  “We discussed separating the Girl by Candlelight from the body, and binding that, somewhere else,” Avery said.  It felt uncomfortable to say.  Matthew looked shocked at first.  The shock dissipated, replaced with a deep, dark sort of concern.  Edith’s expression didn’t change.  It was like she considered that an inevitability.  With everything removed, Snowdrop returned, wiping traces of candle wax off her hands.  Tashlit sat on the stairs, one eye out the window that looked out in the direction of the driveway, able to see who came from upstairs and also see through to where they were with Edith.  John stood by the door.  “You’ve withheld critical information, you haven’t treated us fairly or as equals, and you put us at risk while shirking your stated duty to stand between us and outside threats,” Lucy announced.  She glanced at Avery.  “We think you did all of this because you were a culprit in killing and butchering the Carmine Beast,” Avery said, grateful she wasn’t being left until last this time.  She watched Matthew as she said it.  His eyebrows went up.  He met her eyes, and interrupted Verona, who was about to speak.  “You have proof?”  “We’ll probably get to that,” Lucy said.  “For right now, we’d like answers.”  “Are you familiar with the process of forswearing someone?” the Judge asked.  “We’re not wanting to forswear her,” Avery said.  “Especially if that would destroy her.”  “I recognize and agree to that.  I’m asking, are you familiar?”  “We know the basics, I think,” Verona answered.  “The process here is to be much the same.  It is not necessarily enough to say someone’s word is broken.  Local Lords and forces like myself will often decide or put it to tribunal, whether someone is present or not, and the person will have a chance to defend their word.  In some cases, if an oath is made but there are no witnesses to its breaking, we will test the forsworn in some fashion.  Every one of our methods is different.  Some will appear in person and question the forsworn, others will send a sick old woman to cross their paths and see how the forsworn reacts, judging their character.  Here, there are witnesses, but it is still a test.  Words are open to interpretation.  The one who would be called an oathbreaker gets a chance to defend their word.”  “Can I request assistance and guidance?” Edith asked.  “You may not.  It is your word in question.”  “I would be open to her having someone to give her guidance on what to say and what not to say,” Lucy said, “if that guidance was an outside party familiar with karma and law and not familiar or involved with this situation, sworn to secrecy and unable to pass any information on to potential co-conspirators.”  “Woah what?” Verona asked.  “We’re helping her?”  “This is about justice,” Lucy said, looking back at the Sable.  “I’d want the same for us.  Someone roughly equal to help us make sure we’re not overlooking something.”  “That would take time, wouldn’t it?” Edith asked, turning her attention to the Sable.  “I’d have to stay bound or roughly bound in the meantime?”  “It would, and you would have to come to some form of agreement with the three practitioners of this area on your binding.  Someone uninvolved is someone from outside my purview, by definition.  I would send a servant of mine out east to seek someone out.  I think it would take two days.”  “I don’t want to be bound that long.  No.”  “We-”  “If you want to twist around this call for counsel to bind me for extra days, that reflects who you are and what you’re doing,” Edith interrupted, voice heated.  “We shouldn’t have picked you three.”  “What did you think would happen when you appointed us as investigators?” Lucy asked, just as heated.  “I think going with the Judge and pushing for fairness is pretty reasonable here.  We’re not trying to unravel you by forswearing you.  We’re only trying to fulfill our duties and bring the culprits to justice.  Are we being unfair?”  She looked at John as she asked that.  “Terribly unfair,” Snowdrop said.  “I have minimal objections,” John said.  “Depending on what comes up, I may have none.”  “Thank you,” Lucy said.  “Tashlit?  Are you listening?”  Tashlit nodded.  “Any objections on how we’re approaching this?” Verona asked.  Tashlit shook her head.  “Matthew?” Avery spoke up.  “I don’t know enough to say,” he said, wary.  “Then let us start out by addressing the primary points of concern,” the Sable Prince said.  “Please.  Edith James.  You’re first accused of withholding information.  The argument has been presented to me as such.  You, at the time of their awakening, indicated your agreement for this when you offered your power and consent.  You withheld information about binding.  You withheld information about the true nature of Yalda.  When questioned about your involvement in the Carmine Beast’s murder, you ended the conversation early.”  Avery glanced at John as Yalda came up.  He shifted his footing but gave nothing away.  “Others have withheld details.  You haven’t complained about that,” Edith answered.  “None have been more pointed or blatant than you,” Lucy told her.  “But they’ve withheld details or handled the investigations in ways natural to them, because they’re idiots like Cherrypop or natural manipulators like the Fae, no?” Edith asked.  “How do you respond, Edith James?” the Sable Prince asked.  “That is my response.  If they’d condemn me they’d have to condemn others.”  “Cherrypop was actually pretty helpful and great about it,” Verona told Edith.  “I had to bribe her with nuggets and pit her against the other goblins, but she provided good info.  If we have any issues with the Fae we can address it with them specifically.”  “The Kennet Others agreed to the voting system and agreed to not teach you binding at that time.  You went to learn it elsewhere.”  Lucy folded her arms.  “What was your role in that discussion on binding?  You had a leadership position there, no?”  “I did, but so did Matthew, and it’s not as cut and dry as you paint it.  You wanted to bind the Hungry Choir.  A prevailing sentiment was that you were all hurling yourselves at a very dangerous force that most practitioners were declining to handle, because they weren’t strong enough.  Equipping you with a means of going after the Choir when you weren’t ready is tantamount to sending a man to hunt a werewolf with only a wooden spear.  John?”  “I said something about how I thought they were getting in too deep, too fast, back then.  It was Matthew who said the Choir was too strong for most practitioners.”  “Providing the information and encouraging you on a very dangerous path would have run against my oath to keep the practice and your duties from getting in the way of a long and full life,” Edith said.  “We didn’t stand in the way of you seeking the information elsewhere.”  The Sable Prince nodded.  “This is fine.”  “The Choir was too strong for most practitioners because they lacked the critical information.  Yalda’s nature.  In the car, you guys didn’t correct Charles when he told us it was a Black Dog.”  “She is a Black Dog, or was,” Edith said, glancing quickly at the Sable Prince as she made that last correction.  “The non-standard Dogs of War come in varieties that get loose categories.  They were originally named after the dogs leashed at the warrior king’s heels, the hounds famine, sword, and fire.  Then terms changed. The Black Dogs are a broad category that contains famine, contains sickness, contains plagues of insect or rats.  It fits.  Yalda affected people in ways that could be called famine or sickness, binding the gut.”  “And the interview you cut short?” the Sable Prince asked.  “I did not lie when I said what I said.  The timing was poor.  I left a hard meeting with family and then had a meal with you three.  We talked about my inability to have children and questions of my future with Matthew.  It put me in an uncomfortable state.  If things had carried on I might have said something untrue by accident or out of emotion.  You broke bread with us.”  “You walked away,” Avery said.  “You didn’t let us follow up.”  “I was new to being in charge, adding the coordination of the locals to my responsibilities.  We had to adapt to Miss being gone, and I took it on myself to send spirits to the perimeter to protect this territory.”  “But you didn’t let us follow up,” Lucy pressed.  “You took on a hostile stance with us after that.”  “Dire times.  I held off on providing the information because there were more pressing matters, but holding off is not outright refusal.”  “Putting something off forever is withholding it.”  “Did you have any plans to make a meeting with us and provide the full story?” Verona asked.  “Did you have plans to reach out when things were calmer?”  Edith retorted.  “When were things going to be calmer?” Lucy asked.  “End of the summer?  Too late.”  “By what calendar?  The only task we gave you was to investigate.  It’s not a violation of an oath to put things off.  It doesn’t put you in a spot where you’re in violation of an oath we asked of you.”  “If one of you killed the Carmine Beast with the intention of taking the throne, wouldn’t you potentially be putting yourself in the same role as the Sable?  Getting to decide and control the interpretation of the laws and things that determine how you’re interviewed or what punishments there might be?” Lucy asked.  “I have no intention of being Carmine,” Edith said.  “I wouldn’t want it, I wouldn’t be good at it unless I gave up the human part of me and gave up every part of me that lets me love and care for Matthew.”  “When you say ‘I’ do you mean Edith James with the composite spirit and echoes inside, Edith, or the Girl by Candlelight?” Verona asked.  “All of the above have no intention of being Carmine.  But when I say ‘I’ and I’m not speaking of the body of Edith James as a separate part, I mean the first, body and spirit combined.”  “You just hedged,” Verona accused  “When you say body and spirit combined, you’re leaving out-”  “Echo.  As the girl by Candlelight I’m primarily spirit, Verona.  I am a spirit.”  “This is true,” the Judge intoned, his voice taking that rough quality at the end.  “I want to make an issue of this ‘too late’,” Lucy said, to the Sable Prince.  “Am I right?  Would she get to be in charge of making and deciding the rules?”  “That is our purview.  You called us Judges, and this works as a term.  We manage seal and karmic law, we arbitrate the abstract notions of spirit and Other in most of our purview, depending.”  “Depending?” Avery asked.  “Can you clarify?”  “On depending?”  “On all of it.  We were debating… kind of what you guys are all about.  Knowing what the Carmine used to do and what you do is important.”  “In seal, we can use our influence to force Others to be bound to the Seal as they manifest naturally.  Sometimes this is formalized, other times it is implicit, and imprinted on them at the moment of their creation, as instinct and innate understanding.  To secure innocence, not necessarily to keep innocents alive, but in accepting responsibility if innocence is lost.  To keep to Truth in rule of discourse, holding to one’s word.”  “It was the case for me,” John said.  “I always had a sense of innocence.  I couldn’t lie from the moment I lurched to my feet from the midst of a pile of corpses covered in concrete dust.”  Tashlit nodded.  Finger waving between herself and John.  She gestured more.  “Tashlit too,” Verona interpreted.  “Presumably no corpse pile.”  Tashlit pushed fingers and thumb together to make an oval shape.  “She came from an egg.”  “What about me?” Snowdrop asked.  “You as well, in your own peculiar rule of discourse.  Most Others who are created naturally and created on Earth after the date of the Seal’s origination are bound.  All of the Others of this town are bound.  In places without any Judges, where Lords arbitrate instead, more may slip the net, but Lord, Practitioner, and Other are all obligated to enforce the seal at the earliest opportunity.”  “So that’s the seal,” Lucy said.  “We can be called to arbitrate matters of Truth, or new forms of discourse.  As the Judge most concerned with commerce and civilization, the Aurum Coil manages new rules of discourse, such as music, drama, or technological modes of communication.  In some areas, the Judge may be stricter, in others, more lax.  Over time, the rule of discourse is decided by many Judges and collected spirits in many places.  I understand that your Opossum familiar was momentarily the subject of the Alabaster Doe’s attention when she came into being.  I arbitrate many oaths that come to rest when one or both parties die.  When someone is forsworn, we can intervene and interject.  As I’ve stated, if no person lives to call a broken oath into question, we can step in to do so, directly or with another test.  In most contentious debates, one enemy forswearing the other, the Carmine would decide.”  Avery nodded, placing a hand on Snowdrop’s shoulder.  “Again, we do not hold sway everywhere.  In some places, the collected spirits would draw on the law as established to do this.  In others, or in those same areas, a Lord may hold sway and use their position and power to decide.”  “And abstract notions of spirit and Other?” Verona asked.  “Echoes boil forth and disappear regularly enough.  I can open or close the doors that let this happen, to allow more echoes to roam free, to allow them to be closer to the human world, or force a clear distinction.  The Carmine could decide what bogeymen could rise from the Abyss, and how long their leashes would be.  Our departed Carmine kept a short leash here for the Abyssal things, but allowed many feral beasts of an Other bent to roam in the deeper wilderness, keeping them out of man’s way.  Another Judge would see to matters of faith and the forces tied to that faith.”  “Like spirits in the East, before the Oni conflicts,” Verona said.  “And after those conflicts.  The leashes there, for lack of a better term, are quite long, and Others may deal with innocent fairly directly, provided they keep their nature ambiguous at the very least.  Here we are stricter.  When I said ‘depending’ earlier, there are limitations.  Realms I do not cover.  Some spirit-heavy areas have spirit lords who hold sway and they decide these things.”  “Like Lords in Earth?”  “In a loose interpretation.”  Lucy uncrossed her arms.  “The Carmine being dead… you implied that was the way things once were.”  “Before the seal, before we assumed roles as distant arbiters, stepping in only rarely to avert anything that would disrupt the balance of innocent and Other.”  “Like another group of Judges stopping a great primeval attacking the East coast of Canada?” Avery asked, thinking of Ted Havens, the man who’d gone from birth to age thirty a lot of times.  “That is something we do now, that we wouldn’t have done in the more distant past, yes.  That was handled by other Judges in another area because it would have caused untold harm and almost certainly made thousands or tens of thousands Aware.”  “And her being gone now, that’s changing who is deciding all of this?” Lucy asked.  “The arbitrary stuff on what Other gets to pop up?”  “The default assumption, without the Carmine, is that there are no barriers to the emergence of violent abyssal beasts or bogeymen, wraiths, goblins, or spirits, among many Other things.  It is why Kennet in particular is so bloody.  Her influence is present enough to supplant anything we remaining three might do, but at the same time, lacks any will or ability to assert influence.”  “Thank you,” Lucy said.  “If Edith is one of the responsible Others, then does that mean she or someone working with her would be able to use the Carmine Furs to take the throne, and confound us by letting lots of monsters pop up and keep us from questioning her?”  “That is possible.”  “I’ve already said, it wouldn’t, shouldn’t, and won’t be me,” Edith interjected.  “Do you know who is?” Avery asked.  “I couldn’t say.”  Before Avery could follow up, Lucy held up a finger, thought for a second, and then asked, “Would it be possible, then, for them to oversee Edith’s case, if we then decided she wasn’t providing us everything she said she would, challenged her, and her Judge friend in their new Carmine look could then favor her heavily and tell us to screw off?”  “That is not out of the question,” the Sable Prince said.  “And, if it’s a question of seals and karma… could they then wait until someone challenges us on something, calling one or all three of us forsworn, and have their own person do what you’re doing right now and decide the outcome?”  Avery felt the hairs on the back of her neck stand on edge.  Snowdrop looked up at her.  “There would have to be some merit to the challenge, but yes.  They could even take a very liberal interpretation of what constitutes an Oath and what constitutes breaking it.”  Verona looked at Lucy, frowned a second, then said, “That’s only during their term of service as a Judge?”  “If a matter from before their term started was brought up or if they decided an event left fallow was in their purview, they could arbitrate it as they saw fit, provided it had some merit.”  “And they’d be rid of us,” Avery said, quiet, the hairs that were standing up going all down her spine and arms.  “That seems like a very frigging huge loophole,” Lucy said, her voice rising.  “If someone can take the seat and just arbitrarily decide fuck these three practitioners they have a personal stake in messing with, those guys are forsworn!?”  “That’s- um,” Avery said, hesitating, cutting in before Lucy could get too heated.  Lucy looked at her.  “There’s no way around it?”  “Appeals?” Verona asked.  “Or asking other Judges to handle it?  You guys each have your areas, right?  Does that go for forswearing?”  “If you’ll ask one question at a time I can answer them one at a time.”  “Appeals,” Lucy said.  “Please.”  “There are appeals.  They would usually go to the same Judge that made the same ruling, or the same role.  Carmine to Carmine.”  “But we could go to another?” Avery asked.  “We could go to the Alabaster?”  “Yes, though we rarely change the decisions or intervene in the affairs of other Judges.  Our process is fluid and natural, we instinctively know what the others are doing.”  “So it’s up to them to bring up the case, they can decide the outcome, and then it’s up to them to handle the appeal, and you don’t see what’s wrong with that!?” Lucy asked.  “What about asking another Judge to handle the initial forswearing?” Verona cut in, because Lucy was getting heated.  “One question at a time, please.”  “Hers,” Lucy said, looking briefly disgusted, indicating Verona.  “You could appeal to the Judge and ask them to stand down to be impartial.”  “And are they obligated, is there another force that could…?” Verona asked.  The Sable Prince shook his head.  “Our process is old, simple, and not so convoluted as that.  Enforcement happens by the same laws that defined your bronze age.  If you do not like them, you can challenge the Judge for their seat, or you can establish a Lordship and let the Lordship arbitrate instead.”  “We can’t do that if we’re-” Lucy started.  John touched her shoulder and she reflexively pulled away.  Then she looked back at him, the look in his eyes, and she made herself calm down.  In a more level voice, she said, “We can’t do that if we’re forsworn.”  “Not easily, no.  It would have to be preemptive,” the Sable Prince said.  “I don’t think-” Avery started.  She hesitated, still thrown by this.  She glanced down at Snowdrop, back to Tashlit, then up at John.  “I don’t think that would go over super well.”  “We’ve discussed it,” John said.  “A seat of Lordship invites challenge in the same way the Carmine Throne does.  It also sets standards.”  “Like?” Lucy asked.  “Not being able to keep a perimeter and limit the access of practitioners.  We’d be subordinate to greater Lords of more powerful areas.  Some with subordinates who might take over our Lordship to expand the territory of that superior.”  “Some are practitioners, right?” Verona asked.  “Yes.”  “With kids?  Keeping it all in the family?”  “Yes.”  “There’s no other way to divert this or stop it from coming to pass?” Verona asked.  “You guys don’t go, hey, this is jank, we’re going to step in to protect the role of the Judges?”  The Sable Prince answered, “You’re in the midst of the primary other way as we speak.  I’m here in part because of the gravity of the situation.  If someone has taken the Wrong course to take the throne, it would be good to address that.”  “Uhhhh,” Avery said.  There was a brief pause.  “This really has you concerned,” Matthew spoke up for the first time in a bit.  “Uhhh, yeah,” Lucy said.  “Because I overheard someone, and by elimination, I’m fairly sure it’s Edith here, in this house, saying they’d get rid of us.  And if it’s not her it’s someone, so yeah, it’s a concern.”  “No,” Matthew said.  “I don’t believe it would be Edith.”  “At the meeting we weren’t invited to?  That’s part of point number two, by the way, which I do want to get to,” Lucy told the Sable Prince.  “As you wish.”  Lucy turned back to Matthew.  “-When we crashed it to let you know about the guys who were at the police station?”  “No,” Matthew said.  “I don’t recall that.”  “No?” Lucy asked, pointing an accusing finger at Edith.  “Were you spying?  Because I said something, but that wasn’t the exact wording-”  “It’s my implement, bitch!” Lucy said, pulling back the accusing finger to flick her earring.  “Eavesdropper’s earring.  It’s pretty hard for me to not catch some stuff by mistake.  Which you shouldn’t be surprised about if you did your research about who I am prior to inviting me in.”  “We left that to Miss,” Matthew said.  “Your oversight isn’t my responsibility,” Lucy told him.  “Now, unless someone was fucking with me, your wife said something to that effect-”  “Not to me, not in my earshot,” Matthew said.  “I’m almost certain.”  “Edith, did you or did you not say something to the effect of ‘we can’t keep them from living long lives, but one way or another, we’ll get rid of them?”  “As spirit, echo, body, or some combination of those things?” Verona added.  “Did you say it?”  “And if you said it and Matthew wasn’t there, who was there when you said it?” Avery cut in.  Left to last again, damn it.  “If it wasn’t you, then do you know who it was?”  Edith shook her head, looking away.  She didn’t answer.  “Edith?” Lucy asked.  “There was context.  The new Others in Kennet especially are nervous about you being here as active practitioners.”  Lucy folded her arms, stepping closer.  “By the Awakening Oaths, you pledged to give us a long and full life.  I remember you saying something to the effect of you not needing to worry about us in the long term.  That conflicts.  Confirm, deny, or explain.”  “I can help give you a long and full life without worrying about you.”  “Was that what you were going to do?” Avery asked.  “Or what you are going to do?”  “I’m not perfect,” Edith told the Sable Prince.  “I have a human body and a human brain that hosts me.  It gets tired, and it loses concentration.  With this kind of badgering I may start making mistakes, in wording, judgment, or details.”  “I’ll be lenient with that in mind,” he said.  “And if I don’t want to answer?”  “That’s your choice,” the Sable Prince said.  “We can’t compel her?” Avery asked.  “With you here?”  “You can, but me being here doesn’t force the answers to come.  By the seal of Solomon, Others that are bound can be compelled to give an answer if asked three times.”  We saw that happen with Gashwad.  Or Lucy and me did, anyway.  Avery fidgeted.  Her neck-hairs hadn’t completely settled.  Her fidgeting took the form of fingers touching the seams of Snowdrop’s shirt along her shoulders, and Snowdrop reached out to fidget back, fingers tapping Avery’s fingers, before she took Avery’s hands.  “Do we want to do that, then?” Lucy asked.  “I don’t,” Edith said.  “I would object,” Matthew said.  “Even hearing what you’ve heard?”  “Nothing too incriminating has been confirmed yet.  I have to stand by my wife until there’s more to what you’re saying.  Binding is barbaric and can easily be taken further than initially meant to.”  “This is the fastest way I can think of to confirmation,” Lucy said.  “Find another way.  This is also the easiest route to manipulating the situation to get the answers you want,” Matthew said.  “What if we swore?” Avery asked.  “A binding to get answers, then release.”  “You could release her into a prepared binding circle.”  “We could swear not to.  We could swear to return her to this situation.”  “Which is a soft binding unto itself, on yet-unjustified pretenses,” Edith said.  “And there are other loopholes, and however many I could name and ask you to come up with answers for…” Matthew raised his hands, then dropped them to his sides.  “There are three of you and I am an average man from a far-from-average background and I worry I may not be as smart as any one of you three, let alone all three of you together.  I can’t come up with everything you might do once you have Edith firmly in your control.  I can say no, not in my house, not unless you indict me directly, as you have Edith.”  “Frankly, we think you might be involved in some capacity, but from the way you’ve talked about us, and been open where Edith hasn’t, we don’t think you’re the ringleader,” Lucy said.  “There are others we’d bind before you.”  “I’m talking about what happens here, tonight.”  “Okay,” Lucy said.  She turned away, then started pacing the width of the room, wall to the corner of the jutting room that surrounded the furnace or water heater or both.  “Let’s go back.”  “To?” Matthew asked.  He sounded defensive.  Edith, by comparison, was quiet.  “Three primary arguments against Edith.  We were discussing the sharing of information.  Edith James, from the framing of her response, suggests she had no intention of sharing with us before the end of summer.  But the end of summer, with the way things are slated to go, may see John Stiles dead and one of the conspirators in the murder of the Carmine Beast atop the throne, capable of being lawyer and judge over their own crime.  And over us, for that matter.  Yes?”  “To clarify,” the Sable Prince intoned, “you asked if it was possible.  It is.  But it’s not likely.  The role is a passive, observing one.”  “But it could.”  “It could, but it isn’t likely.”  “Is there any rule or procedure that stops it from happening?  Or stops it when it’s underway?”  “This, here, as I already stated.  Those who would lie or break oaths to arrange the position can be challenged and dealt with before they take that position.”  “Does it always stop them?”  “No.  But it’s rare for it to happen in the first place.”  “So it happens sometimes?” Verona asked.  “Yes.  But rarely, if ever, with the Carmine role or roles like it.  Almost always, it’s the Alabaster.”  “The Alabaster?” Avery asked.  “I went to her domain.  Why her?”  “Because she is the prey animal, the victim, and is vulnerable, by her very nature, just as I am chthonic death, gatekeeper, guide and guide of the other guides and psychopomps of our reality, and the Carmine is bloody violence.”  “To put it in simpler terms,” John said, “the Carmine Beast and those who sit in its throne fight back.  The Alabaster doesn’t.”  “From what the witness Louise told us, the Carmine didn’t really fight back,” Lucy said.  “It seems not,” John said.  “So the only thing that keeps this from happening is convention?” Verona asked.  “The practice is defined in large part by convention.  I wouldn’t say only when it occupies the space it does,” the Sable Prince said.  “Convention, then,” Lucy said.  “That doesn’t feel like enough.”  “What we’re doing here tonight is also a convention,” the Sable Prince told her.  Avery saw the argument getting circular and Edith seemed to be getting ground, so she spoke up, saying, “So we made argument one based on how Edith should have told us things and didn’t.  Binding?  She made an excuse.  The Choir?  She claimed it was a question of labels.  But when it came to her own deeds-”  “After asking us to investigate,” Lucy interjected.  “-She didn’t tell us the full story and seems to have no plans to share it until after she could be punished for it.”  “That’s a big seems,” Edith said.  “As the Sable Prince said, it doesn’t happen often.”  “It sure seems to be happening here,” Lucy told her.  “Moving on to point two?” Verona asked.  “Equality and fairness among the locals,” Avery said.  “I mentioned this one last night.  We were offered a vote but you haven’t held any formal votes where we got a fair say.  You’ve held meetings without us-”  “Did say we’d bring that up,” Lucy told the Sable Prince.  “-And you’ve stated you wanted to get rid of us.  You’ve provided no context for that, yet,” Avery finished.  Edith shook her head.  “I can’t without violating confidence and risking that you’d be irate with one or more of the locals.  That would defeat the purpose of reassuring them.”  “Do you have any points in your defense?”  “Do you have any clearer points to make in the first place?  You’ve been practicing for a matter of months and weeks.  We’ve held six or seven meetings with the full town and several with partial groups.  The span where you were away for several weeks had a good share of those meetings.”  “How many votes did you hold?” Avery asked.  “I don’t know.  For some Kennet Others there were several.”  “We weren’t invited to those.”  “You weren’t here for those.  We voted on whether to bring them in.  You were away.  If you want inclusion you have to be here,” Edith retorted.  “Did you email?  Reach out?”  Verona asked.  “You described Matthew erroneously as a boomer.  As a spirit I am technology averse.”  “A letter?  A phone call?” Verona asked.  “We gave your offerings and considerations for potential Kennet Others their due weight.  One of them is sitting on the stairs, watching out the window in case anyone approaches the house.”  “We didn’t get a say in the rest, though, did we?  By a compared number of votes…?” Avery pressed, worried her argument would be the weakest of them.  John cleared his throat.  They all looked at him.  “It was a lot of votes in total, and if the votes in favor of nominating Peckersnot and Tashlit-”  “Ahem,” Snowdrop cleared her throat.  “I don’t want to be included in this rabble.  I’m better than you guys.”  “-And Snowdrop’s natural inclusion, if those were votes on behalf of the Kennet practitioners, that’s only a small few, compared to all of the goblins, Lis, Nibble, Chloe, Rook, Jabber, Montague, and Ken.”  “Ken was brought on with the three practitioners in mind,” Matthew said.  He looked at Edith, “Right?”  “He explicitly was, to connect to the human element of Kennet.”  “Yeah, uhhhh, no?” Lucy raised her voice, rising up a little taller.  “Because you didn’t ask.  You assumed, and that, Matthew, Edith, is one of the big ways in which you didn’t treat us as equal or involve us in a fair way.  You assumed and you jumped to it and I can tell you right now that I was way less than impressed the moment I read the email summarizing the Ken situation.”  “What?  Why?” Matthew asked.  “Because the spirit of Kennet as a whole is as much a problem as anything.  Now I’ve tried to be open minded and cool but dude, Kennet is kinda a bit racist.  It has, like you admitted, a drinking and drug problem.  Kennet is really awful at looking after itself and standing up for its rights.  I could have and would have told you all of that, but I didn’t get a vote so it doesn’t count.  No.”  “We did talk about all that in the car, driving back,” Avery said.  “And John brought up Rook,” Lucy pressed.  “What was it you said?  Sorry girls, this might be a difficult one but we need her.”  “No vote,” Verona jumped in.  Lucy continued, saying, “With no vote on the matter.  What the hell, dude?  What the hell, Edith?  You use us for some specific stuff that you need a practitioner for, but you don’t include us in this?  We deserved better than that.  We deserve better than being given the short shrift or being told we shouldn’t ask for gifts.  We’ve bled for you.  We went toe to toe with monsters for you.  Come on!”  “These accusations could be leveled against all of the original Kennet Others.”  “You led this group.  Miss was fine but this got worse when you guys took over the leadership,” Lucy said.  “Can you tell us, sincerely and without fiddling around, that you meant to include us?” Avery asked.  “Wholly and fairly?  That you weren’t trying to diminish us or leave us out just in case?”  “Yes,” Matthew said.  The silence followed.  He looked back at Edith.  “Silence says a lot,” Verona told the Sable Prince.  “It also doesn’t confirm matters.  But we’ll keep it in mind.”  “Point three,” Lucy said.  “Harm.  Goes back to what you said at the party.”  “You’ve litigated this,” Edith said.  “Fancy word but we didn’t really finish it did we?” Verona asked.  Avery added, “Can you tell us you didn’t mean to hurt us?”  “I swore not to.  I intended to keep that oath.”  Avery pressed, “Harm in other ways, scaring us away?  Uprooting us from home and family?”  “Many small things crossed my mind and I meant some and only flirted a bit with the rest,” Edith said.  “I couldn’t say for certain everything I considered and didn’t and give you a good answer.”  “Did you intend to follow through on what you said at the meeting and get rid of us?” Avery asked.  Edith didn’t answer.  The hairs on Avery’s neck stood up again.  Lucy addressed Edith, deadly serious.  “Edith James, we intend to bind you by your Word-”  “No,” Matthew interrupted.  “No, Lucy.”  Lucy stopped, but her expression remained serious.  “Matthew,” John said.  “I consider you a friend.”  “It’s not certain.”  “We can use this to establish that certainty,” Verona said.  “No.  I spent so long helping her to become a whole person, I can’t risk that this causes her harm or sets her back.  She’d risk losing things if it was rough enough.”  “We’ll be gentle,” Avery said.  “Have we ever indicated we wouldn’t?”  “Some.  In little, careless things.”  “But mostly.  The little things aside?”  “No.  I can’t agree to it.”  “Thank you, Matthew,” Edith said.  He looked back at her then looked away.  Whatever had come up already tonight, he looked uncomfortable with it.  But he stood by her even with that.  Matthew walked over to a short bookshelf that had been emptied of books and candles and leaned against it, butt against the upper edge, eyes downcast.  “Should we take a break?” John asked.  “Can we?” Lucy asked the Sable Prince.  “Does it weaken anything?”  “Edith should remain here.  You shouldn’t go far.  A short break is fine.  This matter has my full attention tonight, barring extraordinary event.”  “Like a primeval appearing off the shores of the great lake?” Verona asked.  “That would count, yes,” the Sable Prince told her.  They broke away, walking over toward Tashlit.  John followed, but he stopped at the doorway, blocking it, watching them and watching Edith both.  Avery looked for a place to sit, and in the process, thoughts crossed her mind.  She didn’t sit.  Snowdrop plunked herself down, sitting against the wall by the base of the stairs, and then gave her lap a pat, inviting Avery to sit, even though Avery would probably squish her a bit.  Avery moved like she was going to sit down, then turned, passing by John.  “Sable Prince?”  “Yes, Avery Kelly?”  “You said there were other options.  For how we could avoid the consequences of a malign Carmine Beast abusing its position to target us.”  “Yes.  Too many to name, but most are unlikely, down to chance, or difficult to assemble.”  “Is one of those options to just… leave?”  “You’ve sworn an oath to look after Kennet.  You would need to return at some point.”  “But… yes?  We could leave Kennet?”  “You could spend much of your time away from Kennet.  It’s my understanding that this was outlined to you before you had your Awakening ritual.”  “It was.  Okay.  Thank you.”  “You’d need to leave the territory the Carmine Beast holds sway, or you’d need to settle in a place with a Lord.  You’d be vulnerable when you returned and you’d be forsworn if a sound argument could be made that you’d abandoned Kennet entirely.”  Avery nodded.  “Figured.”  “Anything else?”  She shook her head.  Then she returned to the others.  She eased herself down and sat in the hollow between Snowdrop’s knees, as she pressed the heels of shoes with opossum-paw treads together and pulled knees apart until they were nearly touching the ground.  Snowdrop hugged her from behind as she leaned forward a bit.  “What was that about?” Lucy asked.  “Stuff,” Avery said.  “Relevant stuff?” Verona asked.  “Only that we could escape.  At least for a while,” Avery said.  “I heard,” Lucy said, “but what are you thinking?  Leaving?”  “If they want to get rid of us then maybe having us go live elsewhere would get us out of their hair and we could abandon the persecution of the Carmine murderers-”  Lucy was already shaking her head.  “-if we absolutely had to,” Avery told them.  “It’s better than being forsworn.”  “The Hungry Choir was made,” Lucy said, quiet.  “And the people who made it effectively killed hundreds or thousands of vulnerable people.  That’s messed up.”  “So is us getting forsworn if we can avoid it,” Verona said.  “We can do something for those people if we stay free and healthy for the rest of our lives.  Even if we’re not actually going after the culprits.”  “You really want to run?” Lucy asked.  “No,” Avery said.  “I fully intend to stick around.”  “Okay.”  “Are you going to tell them?” Snowdrop asked, cheek resting against Avery’s back.  “Tell us what?” Verona asked.  “You little rat,” Avery said.  “No, no, you don’t get to hug me if you’re pulling stunts like that.  I didn’t want them to worry.”  “That’s fair, I’m definitely a rat,” Snowdrop said.  “Not an opossum.  Can’t you see?”  “Tell us what?” Lucy asked, serious.  “Aw fuck, frig,” Avery said.  “Look, I pretty much already gave my answer.  But my mom’s moving out.”  “Your parents are separating?” Verona asked.  “Yes, but-”  “Seriously?  They seemed to like each other.”  “They do, but-”  “They don’t love each other?” Verona asked.  “They love each other.  Stop interrupting!” Avery said.  “Stop.”  Verona shut up.  “Remember back when we had the awakening ritual?” Avery asked.  “And I asked, um, what would happen if I had to bail?”  “You were thinking about it back then?” Lucy asked.  She looked hurt.  “I was thinking… my mom has this job she’s been doing in Thunder Bay for the last year, and someone quit and she got the head position there.  She goes on weekends and she’s been setting up the new office, and it was always this thing where, like, we might have to move if my mom got set up and my dad didn’t have anything.  But I left homeschool and my siblings did too, and my dad took the opportunity to resume working full time instead of working part time and… he’s good at it.  Earning good money, respected, and he wants to keep doing it.”  “So your mom’s leaving and your dad’s staying?”  “And they’ll be long distance.  They asked earlier, if we kids were to split up… who would want to go?”  “And?” Lucy asked.  “And Grumble would stay by default because he has to, and Dad would stay and Declan and Kerry would stay.  Sheridan and Rowan would go with my mom.  Rowan could follow after Laurie if she gets into school in Thunder Bay and Sheridan wants out of the small town.”  “And you?” Verona asked.  “I said I’d stay.  But it’s hard and complicated, y’know?  And it means, um…”  Lucy gave Avery’s arm a light swat.  “…Verona’s got a maybe escape route and so do I and…”  “I don’t, really,” Lucy said.  “My mom just got a job she wanted.”  “Yeah,” Avery said.  “It’s just a thing that’s happening and if things get bad or scary… it’s an option, right?  You could ask your mom to quit?”  Lucy made a face, pained.  “That’s worst case.  We’re not necessarily there,” Verona said.  “Ugh,” Lucy said.  “It’s a worst case scenario for a situation that’s supposed to be weeks away.  A situation where John would be dead and we don’t want that happening.  Right John?”  “Mmm.”  “We don’t want you to sacrifice yourself.”  “Yeah,” he said.  “Frig!” Lucy hopped down from the stair and up to her feet.  She stopped when she stood where she could look past John to where Matthew and Edith were talking.  “Sorry,” Avery said.  “It’s not even really a big deal right this moment.  It’s got me thinking in certain ways about certain things, that’s all.”  “Don’t abandon me,” Lucy said.  “Don’t make me be the one who stays.”  “Not going to,” Verona replied.  “Really.”  “What are we doing?  What do we ask her?  If we lose this element of surprise, if Maricica comes and interferes, all of this gets harder,” Lucy said.  “Or goblins, or Alpeana, or Lis or Cig.  If word gets out and it becomes an inquisition on us, with no culprit confirmed…”  “Yeah,” Avery replied, her voice almost a whisper.  “I don’t want to waste time.  Frig,” Lucy said.  “Me either,” Avery said.  “It’s an arena, right?  This is our field, we know the tools and rules we have at our disposal, the ref is… reasonably fair?” Verona suggested, shrugging one shoulder.  “He’s fair enough,” Lucy said.  “It’s the system that’s got big gaping holes in it, isn’t it?”  “Usually is,” Verona said.  “Give me some water?” Lucy asked.  Avery got her bag and got water, passing it over.  Lucy drank.  Avery took it back, wiped the mouth, and drank herself.  “Let’s hit her hard and fast,” Lucy said.  “Okay,” Avery said.  “Watch our backs, Verona?  Same as if we were in a fight?”  Verona nodded.  “Hey, Edith,” Lucy said.  She strode past John to the main room of the basement.  “Let’s talk about a few other points, you said you’d be open about information in the future, how are you to answer some questions now?”  “Maybe,” Edith said.  John motioned to Tashlit, indicating they’d take places, and leaped the railing while Tashlit ducked down the stairs, following Verona.  John took up residence as guard and gatekeeper to the basement.  Avery followed Lucy in, one hand guiding Snowdrop, while Tashlit and Verona followed.  “Three missing teenagers.  Do you know anything pertinent that the average person doesn’t?”  “I suspect I do but I can’t say for certain if-”  “Tell me you had no responsibility as conspirator or co-conspirator in going after them and retrieving the furs from them,” Lucy said.  Edith was silent.  “Were you the woman in a mask who made Yalda into the Hungry Choir?” Avery asked.  “What’s this?” John asked.  “Two people, Yalda said, before we got the message from her to you.  Wearing masks, they were involved when she became the Choir.  One was a woman.”  “Tell us that wasn’t you,” Lucy said.  “Come on, Edith.”  Edith was silent.  Matthew gave his wife a long, hard look.  “What happened to the three teenagers, do you know anything pertinent?” Lucy asked.  Edith was silent, almost fuming now.  She looked like she had before she’d blown up and ended the interrogation about her role in the Carmine murder.  Verona touched Avery’s shoulder.  She opened her bag and held it out for Avery.  Avery reached inside and found the hard pencilcase she’d given Verona.  There wasn’t the clatter of a dozen pens and pencils, now.  She opened it, and she got the syringe.  “Matthew, I don’t think you were involved,” Lucy said, looking at Avery.  “I’m asking you, John, Tashlit, and the Sable Prince to please keep our confidence as I ask these next few questions.”  “It depends,” Matthew said.  “Edith James, you were guarding the cabin where the Carmine Furs were held.”  Edith didn’t respond, but her eyes burned now.  Accusatory.  Avery could almost read her mind.  It was you.  Matthew looked back at Edith.  “And this syringe was held there,” Lucy said.  Avery opened the case and showed Edith.  The syringe almost fell.  She had to catch it with a swoop of the case, using her hand to hold it steady.  It moved.  She laid her hand flat and the dark fluid in the syringe lunged, making it point straight at Matthew.  The relief on Matthew’s face was almost palpable.  Avery’s heart sank.  “That looks like faerie manufacture,” Matthew said.  “With a bit of Doom inside, for some reason.  The Edith you saw-”  “We fucking blew her up, Matthew,” Lucy said.  “Verona did, turned her rune against her.  Knocked spirit clean of body.  I don’t think many glamours are that good.  It was Edith, almost certainly.”  Matthew approached, careful, and reached for it.  Avery hesitated, but she saw the dark look in his eyes, hurt, confused, and judged it right and fair to hand him the syringe.  “Be careful,” the Sable Prince said.  “That kind of work is fragile.”  “Were you extracting it from me to deal with it yourself?” Matthew asked Edith.  “You shouldn’t, couldn’t-”  “I’m sorry,” Edith said, with more emotion in her voice than she’d shown all night.  It looked like the look her parents had worn earlier in the night.  With her parents, it hadn’t been guilt because they were doing something for someone else’s benefit, but guilt because they were throwing other lives into chaos for their own.  “Did you extract it?” Avery asked Edith.  Edith didn’t answer.  “Edith?” Matthew asked.  She was silent.  “I’ve had dreams, when I was sleeping.  I’ve woken and found the Doom stronger.  I thought it was because I slept next to you and I considered it the price I had to pay…” Matthew said.  Edith looked away.  Matthew stared at her for a long minute, and then he passed the syringe to Avery.  He walked up to John, who didn’t let him pass.  “The oath,” Verona said.  “I won’t tell anyone.  Bind her and get answers and tell me if you think I can bear them.  I’ll be upstairs.”  ', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': 15.143859425048213, 'meta': {'arc_title': 'Dash to Pieces', 'pov': 'Avery', 'wordcount': '9558', 'series_chapter_number': 106, 'arc_number': '11', 'extra_material': False, 'title': 'Dash to Pieces - 11.3', 'chapter': '11.3'}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': 'c917a37574dffbc1f9397c21769a6b7a'}>,\n",
      "               <Document: {'content': '    One week until the end of summer.  Lucy pulled on a sleeveless, hooded tee in heathered gray with the word ‘squire’ in stylized black letters that ran from armpit to hip, then hiked on some black shorts in a stiff material with a thick white belt.  The shorts weren’t her usual clothing choice, but of her non-winter clothing that actually had pockets, they were the only option that wouldn’t fall down around her ankles if she put anything in those pockets.  Ankle-high socks, black sneakers with signature-like squiggles at the side, then the accessories: the wooden bead bracelet at her ankle, and the friendship bracelet Verona had made for her when making Avery’s, same ankle.  The funny thing about having an implement was that it wasn’t uncomfortable when it should be- someone with a sword implement could sleep in bed with their sword beside them and not worry about being cut, and she could lay her head on a pillow with her earring on, no fuss.  She still took it off at night.  The little things had some effect on how the implement worked, and according to the books, it would grow as she did.  Wearing it to sleep would make it use some of its energy to grow to give some quality of life.  She wanted it to be the sort of thing that would kick in and concentrate its efforts into being effective when she was getting out and about.  Her bag had a slot in the bottom where a compact umbrella or water bottle could be stuffed, but she put a stack of spare spell cards and a marker in there, the little arm on the lid of the marker hooked onto the flap.  She put notebooks inside, along with water bottle, some snacks, more spare paper, her pencil case with things like tape and rune-drawing materials inside, and her wallet.  Her glamour was in a compact she slipped into her pocket.  Her chain necklace with the scratched up dog tag and the weapon ring on it went around her neck.  The dropped watch went into the slim side pocket beneath the main pocket.  Knife.  The question kept recurring.  She had options.  The knife she could heat with an incantation, and they had the dropped knives.  Her conversation with John yesterday afternoon had really driven some questions home.  She felt divided, between a version of herself that fought, that argued, that went to war against people who needed to be warred against, and a version of herself that found other routes, smoke instead of knives, but who felt she wasn’t making an impact.  If she didn’t take the knife, she felt it was important to focus on other things.  She opened the door and peered across the hall.  Her mother was downstairs, Verona had finished up her shower five or ten minutes ago.  It felt awkward, the whole Verona thing.  The argument last night… she’d asked if Verona wanted to sleep in Booker’s room and she’d both been glad Verona hadn’t because that meant there wasn’t any distance, yet anxious with Verona sleeping in the room.  “Ronnie?” Lucy called across the hall.  “What?” Verona called back, through the bathroom door.  “Can I grab some of your notecards?”  “Go for it.”  She took some blank notecards, then set about trying to figure out how to put her idea into motion.  This wasn’t in the textbooks she’d read, but she knew that what was set out in action and word could be put to diagram.  She wanted it to stick on impact.  So… mars sign, like Avery had used with her ‘smash with the weight of stone’ hockey stick.  She searched up the notes on connections they’d used for doing up the proper ‘murmuring’ connection diagram so her mom wouldn’t feel like they were gone, and found the various connection signs.  The un-knotted circle worked as the ‘zero’, the ‘fool’, and did have its effects on connections, barring many, or securing them within the circle, or connecting every individual at the perimeter, but it depended a lot on the power that went into it.  Then there was the knotted teardrop shape, vaguely triangular, but with two blunted, rounded corners and one emphasized one, as the ‘one’, the ‘magician’, representing hand, flame, raindrop, mountain, exhalation.  A symbol for connection to elements and power.  A certain form of it appeared on the borders of some elemental texts, so they could draw accurate runes without the book coming alive with power.  The ‘two’, the interconnected diamonds or interconnected eye shapes was the ‘two’, the ‘high priestess’, and leaned pretty heavily into both connection between the ‘real’ and the practice, and the division between such.  Use of the high priestess worked well for separating oneself from the innocent.  The ‘three’ could be the triquetra or valknut, often a line between civilization and nature.  A tool to manipulate insects and animals, or to secure hearth, home and family.  The empress.  The ‘four’ was the emperor, war, the shield knot.  It could be circular with a square formed by the interlocking lines in the center, or square with a circle formed.  Best used on those who would do harm.  This would be used on them.  She put the image on her phone, put paper over her phone, and traced it, using a small ruler for the lines.  She surrounded it in a circle, and filled in the gaps between circle and line, darkening it as evenly as she could.  Verona came in, dressed, hair damp and uncombed, and spotted Lucy at work.  She leaned over the desk, curious.  The fight from last night felt unresolved.  “What’s the plan?” Verona asked.  “I’m thinking… inverted shield knot, connected to the mars sign.”  “Stick to the aggressor on hit, sure.  Papers like to stick to targets anyway, you know.”  “I want this to stick hard.”  “Okay.”  “Then on the other side, lesser shield knot, with a mars sign inside it.”  “Connect to… the aggression itself?”  “Yeah.  Can I demonstrate?”  Verona nodded eagerly.  “Let me just finish… gotta fill this in, I’ll draw the other knot… smaller.”  Verona seemed to be itching to do it herself.  “How’s the gainsaying?” Lucy asked, as she drew.  She shrank the image on her phone by pinching it, then traced it.  It was hard to see through the notecard.  Barely a guide.  “Better.  Zed’s right, doing the ritual helped.  I think I’ll be weak but able to help out more tomorrow.”  “That’s great,” Lucy said.  Verona didn’t get angry or upset often but she’d been angry and upset last night.  Verona had said she didn’t want to go to bed angry or to harbor resentment so she was putting it to rest and Lucy was left thinking, how can you be that upset and then put it to rest that easily?  At least practice stuff was a good bonding exercise.  “I’ve gotta whap you.”  “If it’s for the sake of experimentation,” Verona said, sober, standing straight and clasping hands behind her back.  Lucy wrapped up a bundle of scrap paper they’d been using for doodles and quick-form experimentation, and then adopted a fighting stance.  She flung the notecard into the air, then swung the rolled-up papers at Verona’s head.  The paper in the air moved, getting caught by the papers mid-swing.  The rolled up papers connected with Verona’s head, and the notecard stuck to Verona’s wet hair.  It fluttered to the ground a few seconds later.  “It would’ve stuck harder if you actually were someone who was aggressive toward me.  As my friend, zero upset feelings, that’d last for zero seconds…” Lucy said, trailing off.  “Maybe it stuck for the time it did because my hair’s wet.”  “Maybe,” Lucy said, picking up the paper.  “Or that’s just the effect of us being strong, with a lot of Kennet’s power behind us.”  “Could be,” Lucy said.  “Or you’re a little upset, still?  Are we okay?”  “I don’t want to hold grudges, so I’m not.”  “Right.  That’s… it still stuck for a few seconds there.”  Verona sighed.  Lucy backed off, hands raised.  “Okay.  Sure.”  “Take my word for it, okay?” Verona asked.  “Sure.  Will do.”  “That’s cool, though.  I can see you like, scattering a bunch into the air, and then you’re holding a rapier, and each thrust sticks one to your enemy.  Then you have runes primed to explode.  All together, kablooie.”  “If I want to be super violent, yeah.  I’m kinda thinking of this stuff so I don’t have to go that route.”  “What then?  Binding?  You want to tie them up?”  “Maybe.  I had other ideas.  I was thinking I’d check on John, see how he’s doing, and since he knows the goblins, they’re both, uh, issues.  Blunt, Blunt’s crew, Gash, Tatty’s group.”  “Makes sense.  We’ve gone over the lists, the big ones we haven’t figured out are, what, the goblins, Miss and what Avery saw last night, Ken?  And a lot of question marks for the others, where maybe we should keep an eye out for trouble, but they’re probably not a direct issue?”  “And the conspirators.  Maricica and Lis are in the wind.  They have agents out there.  The animals, the beautiful man.”  Verona nodded.  “I can imagine Avery wanting to handle talking to Ken.  I think she gets him best.”  “Yeah.  We have a week.  Me going and talking to John feels like the best way to cover the most bases-”  Verona nodded in an exaggerated way.  “-see what he thinks, he knows the goblins.”  “I’m going to putter around, get some stuff set up that I don’t need practice for, check on Tashlit, make sure Avery’s doing okay.  I might take some time to relax, recharge, get centered.”  “If you need to, for sure,” Lucy said.  “If I’m sorta useless right now while I’m gainsaid, then spending time to recharge now so I’m better when I have magic again is just sensible.  Unless there’s stuff you need?”  “Nah.  Double emphasize the checking on Avery thing.  We should invite her over if we’re allowed while grounded.  I think she wanted to hang with Zed, Brie, and Jessica today.”  Verona nodded.  “Just so I know where you are, will it be with Tashlit?”  “Are you my mom, needing to figure out where I’m at?  Because even my mom doesn’t do that.”  “I’m a concerned member of our group in the middle of a really stressful, dangerous time, with witch hunters roaming around, and I don’t want to be completely screwed over if our phones stop working or if I need to send some of our allies your way.”  “Okay.  I’ll be with Jeremy, if I can wrangle it,” Verona said.  “Some clothes-off time, some time with Sir, chatting…”  Lucy frowned.  “What?” Verona asked.  “Are we okay?  Is this okay?” Lucy asked.  “I’m okay right now.  I think you’re being a bit of a tit about things, but whatever, so long as you don’t get on my case, we’re good.”  I think the way you phrased that suggests you’re not okay right now.  But okay.  “Have fun,” Lucy said.  “That’s the plan.”  She drew up some more cards, and with Verona’s input, wrote out the epithets.  She sorted and arranged them, then put them in a back pocket.  Verona got sorted out as well, a little less intensive, and less ready for a possible fight.  “Have you eaten?”  “Hm?” Lucy asked.  “No.”  “Cool.”  They headed downstairs together.  Lucy’s mom was sorting out laundry, carrying two baskets up to the front hall, one stacked on the other.  She left Lucy and Verona’s basket in the hallway, a piece of cardboard separating the two halves.  “Take that up and put it away?” her mom called over.  “Yep!” Lucy replied.  “Don’t go wandering off in separate directions either.  I’ll be right down, I want to talk,” her mom called down the stairs.  Verona got some toastoat toaster cookies out of the freezer, held up the bag while making a quizzical sound, and Lucy nodded.  She ran the basket upstairs, put stuff away quickly, then hurried down before her mom could get down, just in time for the second batch of toaster cookies to pop up.  She put the filling on one, pushed them together, got some juice, and sat down across from Verona.  “Thank you for being prompt with the laundry, nicely done,” Lucy’s mom said. “It would be great if you ate actual food.”  Lucy, mouth full, grunted and pointed at the orange juice.  “That’s sugar with a bit of vitamins more than anything else.  Okay, gotta be a mom-slash-guardian for a few minutes.  Bear with me.”  They gave her their full attention.  “Are you guys okay?  That was an argument you guys had last night.  Poor Avery sat out there for a while before giving up and leaving.”  They’d caught up with her later, for the ritual.  She wasn’t wrong though.  “I’m cool enough, I can drop it if Lucy does,” Verona said.  “Gotta try to make it up to Ave.”  “Yeah,” Lucy said.  “I don’t know about dropping it exactly-”  Verona pushed her plate about three feet to her left, plate banging glass, and banged her forehead against the counter of the little kitchen island with the stools around it.  “-I just… don’t do that.  Please tell me you can at least see where I’m coming from,” Lucy told Verona.  “Even if you don’t agree, because I’m trying to see where you’re coming from.”  Verona lifted her head up an inch or two, then banged it against the counter again.  “Do we need to have a talk?  Mom-mediated?” Lucy’s mom asked.  “Maybe,” Lucy said.  “If it gets us to a better place?”  “I don’t want to talk with a parent-ish figure about what I’m up to with boys, thank you very much,” Verona said, forehead still resting on the counter.  “Head up,” Lucy’s mom said.  Verona sat up, pulled her plate closer, and took a bite, before giving Lucy a look, like she’d smelled a fart.  “No faces, no shouting, okay?  I hope you got it out of your system, but this stuff is draining and I have work later.”  “Can we uh,” Lucy said.  “Can I think on this?  Give it some time, talk to Avery and Zed and people, and come back to this?”  “I sorta kinda don’t love that I’ve got this thing that’s supposed to be easy and fun, and people are sticking their nose into it and talking about it like Jeremy and I aren’t even a part of the conversation,” Verona said.  “So you don’t want me to figure this out?”  “I want you to butt out!  If you can’t wrap your head around it, then don’t!  Just leave it be!  It’s a me and Jeremy thing!”  “I want us and boys to be a best friend thing!”  “Then work on that, figure it out without round table discussions and talking behind my back with a bunch of people about how I tick and what me and Jeremy are doing!  I don’t want your mom knowing!  It makes it feel less easygoing and less neat!”  “As I don’t know the full picture, I do want to check, are you being safe?” Lucy’s mom asked.  “You’re not-?”  “See!?” Verona raised her voice.  “How awkward is this?”  “Easy,” Lucy’s mom said.  Verona moved her plate and went to thunk her head on the counter again.  Lucy’s mom blocked it, putting hand between forehead and counter.  “Can we call it quits on this conversation?” Lucy asked.  “Please,” Verona muttered, head down, barely audible.  Lucy’s mom lifted Verona’s head up with the back of her hand.  More audible, Verona said, “Please.”  “Come back to it later?” Lucy asked.  “Or never,” Verona said.  Lucy’s mom huffed out a sigh.  “Fine.  Either one of you can come to me to talk.  Verona, there’ll be no judgment.  Lucy?  Be sensitive to what Verona wants to keep private, if you do.  This is always a tricky time to navigate, when you have a good friendship but boys come into the picture.  I think you have something special, it would be a shame for something to spoil it.”  “I don’t think-” Verona started.  She looked at Lucy.  “We’re not, like, gonna stop being friends over this?”  “I love you, Ronnie.  No.”  “Love you too.  Even if you are a tit sometimes.”  “Easy does it,” Lucy’s mom cut in, before Lucy could retort.  “Okay.  I thought that would either take one minute or five hours.  Now, I’ve got some good news, more good news for Verona, and other news for Verona.”  “Bad news?” Lucy asked.  “Other news, I’m being impartial here,” her mom said.  She could read the look in her mom’s eyes.  “Bad news.”  “Hit us with the good, Mrs. Ellingson,” Verona said.  “I think we need it.  What’s my good news?”  “Your mom wants to come into town, take you out, and go shopping.”  Verona made a bit of a face.  “I already got clothes.”  “She wants to spend time with you, and video calls are sterile.  It’s a good thing.”  “Yyyyyeah,” Verona said, looking at Lucy.  “Okay.  Cool.”  We don’t have a lot of time, and that’s a whole thing.  “What’s the other good news?” Lucy asked, hopeful.  “I talked things over with Verona’s mom and Connor.  Separate calls, trying to figure out if I’m on the right track as I make a judgment call.  You’ve been grounded for a week, there’s a week left, but what Brie, Zed, and Jessica said last night sounded real.  I believe Brie, I like that group, I believe your heart is in the right place and it has been across many little incidents.”  Lucy took a sip of orange juice, keeping her expression as neutral as she could.  “I wish you’d communicated better.  I wish you’d called an ambulance for Brie instead of staying downtown, where I’d rather you weren’t hanging out in the evening.  You absolutely deserved to be grounded for being out past curfew.  But you’ve been grounded a week, we can count that as time served.  I think some of this fighting is that you’ve been in close proximity for a while, you do have wonderfully different personalities, and that’s great, but it can make things harder.  So…”  Verona held up both hands, fingers crossed.  “Yeah.  You’re off the hook.”  Verona thrust her fists overhead.  Lucy pumped one fist, smiling.  “On probation.  Be good, do extra chores, don’t fight like you did last night, don’t make a big mess if I leave you alone.  Okay?  Don’t make me feel like I’ve failed you by going easy on you.  Convince me you’re as good as your older friends made you sound.”  Lucy nodded.  “I’ve got to work every day this week, and there are going to be mornings I’m gone, and there are going to be afternoons I’m out.  You’re teenagers, consider this a trial run for adulting.  Fend for yourselves for breakfast or dinner and bed, and to warn you, I may have the neighbor come and do a spot check.”  “She’s super lonely, you know,” Lucy said.  “She always stays for twenty minutes or so, making small talk.”  “Yeah.  But she’s a good neighbor and a friend, so put up with it.”  “What’s the bad news?” Verona asked.  “How bad is it?”  “I want to reaffirm that this isn’t bad news.  I do know you weren’t looking forward to this, but the CAS worker reached out, and he wants to do a quick sit-down with you and your dad-”  “Nah,” Verona interrupted.  “-as supervised interaction.”  “Nah,” Verona said.  “Not interested.”  “I think it’s a necessary step if you do want to go back to your dad’s.  Which- you do want?”  “I’d stay if I could but I can’t, and I want to stay in Kennet,” Verona said.  Lucy’s mom didn’t reply to that.  She waited, a slightly apologetic look on her face.  Lucy looked over to Verona, who was frowning.  “Or maybe…” Verona sighed.  “Big nah?  No?  Not interested?”  “The CAS worker will be in touch, sometime in the next few days.  He brought it up to me, your mom knows, your dad knows, it’s just a question of when.  I said I’d bring it up with you in an impartial way, because it would be easier coming from me.”  “Meaning if you cause a fuss, it’ll look bad for my mom,” Lucy said.  Verona groaned.  “I didn’t say that,” Lucy’s mom said.  “But you’re not not saying it?”  Her mom shifted position, deliberately ignoring Lucy.  “Keep your schedule open for both your mom and the CAS meeting.  For now, you’re free.  Be good, don’t make me regret ungrounding you.”  Verona, looking weary, turned to Lucy.  “Want to go our separate ways until dinner?  Maybe grab Ave and make something?”  “You’re out tonight for work?” Lucy checked with her mom.  “I’m out with a friend,” Lucy’s mom said.  “Working late past dinnertime tomorrow as well.”  “Is this a man friend?” Verona asked, “it came up last night, cute doctors?”  “No comment.”  “So you guys can get up in my business but I can’t get up in yours?  That seems unfair,” Verona said.  “Go.  Get out of my hair, I’d love to have my own house without two grumpy grounded teenagers stumping around.  Stay in communication, know that I love you both.  Again, stay in touch.”  Well, they were free.  Not that they’d held one hundred percent to the grounding, and they’d slipped off enough, but now they could go out without stressing about setting everything up right.  Lucy grabbed her bag, chugged some water, and paused to watch Verona pull on her shoes with the drawings she’d done on the sides.  “You don’t need to watch over me,” Verona said, meeting Lucy’s eyes.  “I’m fine, I’ll deal, we’re cool.”  Saying anything in response to that that didn’t gainsay Verona carried a risk of Lucy being gainsaid instead.  She only nodded.  Nods were safe.  With that, Lucy headed out the door.  John.  🟂  Nat liked the bridge as her hang-out spot, and she pointed Lucy in the direction John had gone, walking past the end of the bridge toward downtown.  Lucy followed the water, letting the wind blow down from mountain and through valley, past school and hospital to the slope of the water.  It was a steady, constant breeze.  Teenagers and families were camped out, doing their own thing.  Young kids splashed in shallow water, wearing plastic sunhats and puffy swimsuits around diapers, while parents made sure they didn’t slip.  She rounded a bend in the shore, passed a rockier part, after navigating some trees, and found a nook where some teenage and twenty-something girls were sunbathing, belly down, swimsuit tops on but undone at the back.  They startled a bit at her approach, and she hurried on her way.  Two more bends away, past a thicket of trees, there was a spot with a lot of junk gathered.  An inflatable raft had deflated badly, and was propped up on one side with sticks stuck into the ground.  A bit of a lean-to tent, covered partially with sticks and dry leaves and caked in mud.  The lime green stuck out despite their efforts.  A summer project for a group, it seemed.  Ramjam sat happily inside, paging through a waterlogged teen fashion and advice magazine with wavy pages.  It looked like he had a collection of pilfered snacks and a partially full beer bottle beside him.  “You okay there?” she asked.  “Girls are great,” he said, turning the page.  “We don’t have girls like this down in the Warrens.”  “That, uh, doesn’t surprise me.”  “Or pretty clothes.  Or makeup.  Some girl goblins really need good makeup.”  “Yyyeah.  Taking a break from things?”  “Yeah!  Worked hard and now I’m protecting this fort and studying about girls.”  “Sure,” she said.  “Be sure to get sleep.  Have you seen John?”  “He went up… thataways,” Ramjam said, pointing.  Further up the shore, toward the House on Half street, one corner of downtown.  “Right.”  She stepped around a grouping of sharp sticks he’d probably brought with him.  “I didn’t know a douche was actually a thing!” Ramjam whispered, excited.  “I thought it was a weapon all this time.”  “Bye Ramjam.”  “Don’t douche.  Trust your body’s natural chemistry or see a doctor.”  “Bye Ramjam,” she said, again.  “Bye.”  If Ramjam was cooperating with the conspirators, her instinct was that it was an unwitting cooperation.  Fuck, though, she really hoped it wasn’t witting or unwitting.  She walked up the shore for a bit, until she couldn’t be sure which direction John had gone.  She paused, found a vantage point on a hill at the edge of a neighborhood that had once had grass and was now being torn up and turned into sloped brick for some reason, then she took the dog tag necklace in hand, and whispered, “John Stiles”.  She sensed the connection.  She found it with her Sight and with her eyes, she traced that trail of watercolor that stabbed through the air, faint as smoke.  She followed it.  She came up on the Arena.  It was bounded on two sides by trees, and two more sides by parking lots, one large one at the front and one smaller one at the back, with more trees and sometimes a rink there.  She kept close to the trees, peering around to see if she could see John.  She pulled cards out from her bag and scribbled out a silence rune, trusting her earring implement to help turn the scribble into something intelligible.  She tucked a card with a rune into each sock, hugging her ankles.  On one side there was enough space for cars to pass single-file, more for employees, sports teams who’d be around a while, and extreme overflow for events, too exposed for her to use for the approach, unless she waded into denser trees.  She took the other route, a footpath with branches bristling with dense pine needles sticking out at face and chest level.  The branches were primed to smack any faces of passerbys, or to transfer spiderwebs and spiders to the unwitting.  She made a face and was very careful to avoid them, but she could still feel the faint touch of the trailing webs.  Cigarette butts littered the ground, as did stray bits of trash.  She spotted John in the trees, holding a gun pointed in her general direction, finger off the trigger.  He moved the gun away and turned his back on her, his focus on other things.  She approached, and squeezed by until she was between him and the building, her arm touching his.  She reached down and penned a simple connection block beween them and Musser’s group.  To help, even though low branches already helped to hide them, as they crouched in the trees, in the shadows, at the edge of the building.  She pricked the back of her finger, and let blood drop onto the connection block.  “For Kennet, we need this to work, so… be power hungry, keep this glyph secure, even against someone as strong as Musser, please.  Take of my power, take of Kennet’s, but… hold.”  The white chalk became red, taking on a heat shimmer.  “That should help.  I thought it was you,” he said, quiet.  “You called my name earlier?”  “Once, to find you.”  He nodded.  Musser was out there in the back parking lot.  Four of his more human-looking familiars were with him.  “His three other familiars remained back with his child and niece,” John murmured.  “These four serve as bodyguards.  How is your ability to identify Others?”  “I… don’t know.”  “Okay.  Middle of the group, black hair, pale skin.”  Lucy nodded. The woman was beautiful, wearing a top that sparkled like diamonds.  “She doesn’t sweat, her skin isn’t red even though she’s pale and standing in the summer sun.  Virtually anyone else with skin like that would burn in a matter of minutes.”  “Notice how she stands in the middle of the group.  Even as they wander and take in details, the others surround her, protecting her.”  “She’s vulnerable?”  “I think she’s more vulnerable than they are.  She moves with confidence.”  John’s voice was so much a whisper there was a hoarse quality to it.  “She doesn’t move as if she’s scared of being attacked.”  “Because she doesn’t care?” Lucy asked.  “If you’ll trust my expertise, I’ve seen people who didn’t care if they died.  I don’t believe that’s the case with her.  Do you remember Sol Ferguson?  The boy who could put his arms together and make explosions?”  “Yeah.  I remember his mom, too.”  “We saw him that last night I was at the Blue Heron.  I think this woman would be something similar to him.  Her confidence comes with bearing a lot of power, even if she’s reluctant or unsure about using it.  I’d think they protect her so that even as the situation turns, she’ll be able to use that power.  Whatever it may look like.”  “Okay, sure.  Makes some sense.”  “I don’t know this for sure, I only know what instinct and experience tell me.  But instinct and experience have given me a puzzle piece and it does fit with other things I see around her.  How they treat her, how they move.”  Lucy used her Sight.  “She has small knives in her.  The flesh around the wounds is cracked, not bleeding.”  “Hmmm.”  “Manufactured, not natural?”  “Perhaps.”  The cracks were surrounded by dark stains.  To Lucy’s Sight, the woman was forced to bend over a bit because of the blades set between bones.  “Do you see the old woman, at the back?” John asked.  “Hideous?”  Lucy looked, with Sight and without.  “No,” she replied.  He paused, looking at her, then said, “Describe who you see.”  “A man in a tight black shirt and pants, smiling wickedly, looks like a musician…”  “Yes.”  “Uhhh…” She assessed one figure, who was taller than the rest, Musser included, and stood at an odd angle, stooped, as if her back was a bit broken, arms hanging limp at her sides.  Her hair hung down on either side of her face, masking her features, and she wore a long black raincoat, black apron with leather strings, and a surgical mask.  With the Sight, she saw… different things.  The figure was heavily stained, making the black of the raincoat swirl like black water had blacker ink in it- and the way she stood was a little bit clearer, especially with knives and broken blades stuck into the raincoat, making it sit in a different way.  She could see the outline of heads and shoulders, a quarter of the way down and then halfway down.  She could guess, based on proportion and how short the legs seemed beneath that coat.  “I think four child sized Others wearing a raincoat and aprons.  Possibly Abyssal?”  “Abyssal, yes.”  “Bogeyman?” Lucy asked.  “I don’t know.  I’ve been wondering.  I don’t know enough about labels.  Bogeymen lean aggressive, feeding on fear and anger.  They’re often restless.  If she’s a bogeyman, she’s the most docile, least aggressive one I’ve ever seen.”  Lucy watched the figure walk closer to Musser, as he pointed a finger at one corner of the lot.  Where the rink had been.  The boards had been picked up and were leaning against trees, covered in tarp.  They’d been painted and would be painted again as the new season started, but even paint didn’t cover up the weathering of the wood.  It was dried and frayed even when slathered in fresh white and red.  “Something else of the Abyss, maybe,” Lucy whispered.  “Perhaps.  And the last one?”  The last one stood apart, far end of the parking lot, watching Musser and watching the lot.  “There’s a woman.  Older teens or twenty.  Old clothes, well worn, plaid-print shawl or cape or something swept around her shoulders, even in this heat.  White, blonde, badly taken care of hair, looks almost like straw, tied into a braid.”  “Older teens or twenty?”  “I think?”  “To me, she’s aged, moles growing out of moles, stretch marks on loose skin, which ranges from dry and flaking at the parts most exposed, to overly moist in the folds.  Her hair is caked with fluids.  Knobby limbs, long.  You could mistake her for human, but it would be hard.”  “Hm.”  Lucy turned on her Sight.  She described what she saw, “Watercolor bleeding out around her.  Very bright colors.”  “You’d know better than I what that means.”  “Tied into the environment?  Or a leaky power?  I tend to only see danger, pain, hurt, and whatever she’s got is bright enough to push into my way of seeing.  Like colors bold enough to make a colorblind person see…”  She trailed off as Musser spoke, voice low.  “I want Hans’ knowledge of blood.”  They shrank back into cover as the Abyssal Other looked around, then fell forward, arms catching it as the woman nearly faceplanted.  The coat and apron came undone, and the Others practically crawled over one another to rearrange.  One shook out a coat, while others bundled up the raincoat and apron.  The girl, about four feet tall, eyes so shadowed by a deep brow that they couldn’t be made out, took the spot on the ground, rolled up apron and coat at her shoulders to cushion the weight as another sat on her shoulders, another on top of him.  A boy with a strong jaw and messy dark hair took the spot on the top before pulling the long suitcoat on.  Hands buttoned it up.  None of them had had arms long enough to fill the long sleeves, but arms nonetheless did fill the sleeves of the coat, a large set of man’s hands extending out the ends.  One held a knife, scuffed and rusty, which it played with for a second, the other a battered and crumpled bowler hat, which it shook out to fullness and firmly set on his dark-haired head.  “What do you see, Hans?”  “It’s everywhere,” the boy replied, with a voice deeper than Bluntmunch’s.  “Washed away by rain and time, but I see it.  Death by five thousand bites.”  “I think that would be the Devouring Song they wanted me to help with.”  “They’re bound.”  “Alexander and Raymond managed the binding.”  “They’re talking about the Choir being partially responsible, being bound.  This Other can apparently figure out a lot from looking at old blood patterns.”  “Each ‘head’ with a different capability, perhaps,” John said.  “I think that may be the most dangerous of the four, even if you ignore how versatile they are.”  “Instinct?”  “Informed instinct.  The way they’re treated, the way they move…”  “The fact they’re kinda ugly and he seems to like pretty and neat looking Others?”  “Yes.  I didn’t dwell on that point.”  “So they’re apparently the most powerful-”  “Dangerous, out of this quartet, possibly excepting the practitioner.”  “-most dangerous of this quartet, possibly outside of the practitioner, sure.  The woman who looks young to me and old to you is a puzzle.  The pale woman with the nice shirt is a really heavy hitter, but not necessarily in a way that makes her most dangerous…”  “Yes.”  She looked at the ‘musician’ type with the black top.  “Look at how he moves.”  The guy paced, looking around.  He walked over to the woman with the nice top.  “Hoping for a fight to liven things up, Nova?”  “No.  There’s no need for any liveliness, and I’m used to long waits.”  “Looking for a fight to liven things up, he says.  She says she’s used to long waits,” Lucy repeated.  “Her name is Nova.”  “Hm.”  When Nova didn’t engage with him more, the guy walked away, walking over to the stacked sections of wood that would bound the rink in the wintertime.  “Describe him.”  “Agitated, restless.”  “What’s his plan?  What orders has he been given?” John asked.  The guy lifted up tarp.  “I… don’t know?”  “N-O-V-A waits, keeping to the center of the group.  As the man wearing black walks away, she moves to stay closer to the center, but she avoids intruding too close to the practitioner who owns her.”  Lucy winced.  “The Abyssal Other follows instructions.  He’s still analyzing the blood?”  “Drip, drip, head lowering slowly, look at the timing… she wasn’t here that long.”  “Muttering to himself, but it’s about blood,” Lucy told John.  “And the young-old woman?” he asked.  “Standing at the back, keeping watch.  It’s… Verona-ish?  Kinda?”  “I don’t know if the orders were given as they got here, or if they’re instructions and roles they default to, but let’s turn our attention back at the skinny man with the black shirt.”  “Right.”  The man moved some boards, kicking one.  “One waits and watches, but she’s not so good at watching that she can see us, or if she is, she’s staying quiet for other reasons.  One holds to the middle, a lot of power at the ready.  Another, more aggressive and immediately dangerous, acts as his right hand.  And the last?”  “Investigative?  I really don’t know, John.”  “Not investigative.  I’m not trying to trick or pressure you, but to get you thinking about what the enemy might do before we know much else about them.  The fact he has no clear role is important.  The practitioner that heads that family and the Blue Heron is a commander with a firm grip over those under him.  Yet he allows one to roam more free than the others.”  Lucy nodded.  Something animal fled from amid the pallets as he moved them.  It looked like a family of raccoons.  They ran for the woods, crossing a section of parking lot – two larger ones, two pups.  Trees bowed and flexed out of the way as they ran into the cover of the woods.  The skinny young man with black hair, black shirt, and black jeans reached out a hand, and his shadow lunged out in four or five segments, diagonally across the lot, a section for the head, for the reaching arm and fingers, for the bend of his leg.  One of the larger, plump raccoons was tossed into the air as the shadow lanced beneath it.  Shadows rippled, arched off the pavement lot, and manifested teeth, reaching up.  The raccoon was bitten in half.  The raccoon’s upper half bounced once on ground before hitting shadow, falling into the darkness as if there was no ground there, only a hole.  Shadows withdrew like elastic bands snapping.  The second of the large raccoons was hauled to him with such speed and force that limbs bent the wrong way, back snapping audibly from where Lucy crouched, the length of a skating rink away.  The head went straight into the man’s mouth, even though it was too large to rightly fit inside his mouth.  He beheaded it, tearing with a jerk of his head.  The pups were already in hand, one dead, the other fighting.  Lucy itched to do something, because they were just animals trying to get by, but-  Before she could he killed the survivor, biting around head to the neck and tearing head from body.  He took the head of the other, then stood there at the end of the lot, blood coating chin to throat to the neckline of his shirt, a beheaded adult raccoon in one hand, two beheaded pups between the fingers of his other.  The second adult raccoon was gone, the only mark it had been there a single ‘splat’ of blood on the end of the parking lot.  Nova, the one with the nice top, had turned away, not watching the man eat.  “Chaos.  Being orderly means being predictable,” John said.  “He keeps one agent of chaos in his group.  Someone who pokes at bears, who peers behind curtains, and who upsets patterns, so they can’t fall into a routine with routine weaknesses.”  The man dropped the headless bodies to the ground.  They fell through his shadow.  Fresh skin folded over the blood on his face, then smoothed out.  “What’s the plan here, John?” Lucy whispered.  “If they notice us, run.”  “Okay.  I can get behind that.”  Lucy looked down at the glyph she’d put down.  “But why are you here?”  “Sometimes there are opportunities.  I’d like to watch for one.  Whatever you’re fighting, if you watch and wait, they’ll almost always give you a chance.”  “Pretty high risk.”  “That practitioner is the strongest immediate threat.  With several Witch Hunters dead, he holds a position of power at the moment.  The loss of his son hasn’t slowed him down, and he’s devoted very little time to visiting the hospital, or to the cabin, now that his son has been moved.”  “He was hurt badly, right?”  “His face was lacerated by a familiar gone rogue.  Miss assures us they were given the opportunity to retreat.  The boy didn’t take it.”  Lucy nodded.  “You’ve asked why I’m here.  That’s why.  Perhaps I can slow the practitioner down or take away something vital from him.”  “Perhaps you’d get bound.”  “That is a risk.”  “What happens then?  There’s no contest to the throne.”  “I don’t know, Lucy.  Perhaps the Judges would intervene, making an offer to the man.  Perhaps they have another backup.  I’ll endeavor to avoid being bound.”  “Please,” Lucy whispered.  “Again, though, you asked why I’m here.  That’s why.  Why are you here?”  “I wanted to talk about things, question you.”  John nodded.  He didn’t take his eyes off the practitioners.  “Hans?”  “The local Others, ones we met, they were here shortly after it died.”  “Can you track them?”  “I can track where they went after, but not before.  You could ask Rabbit Killer.”  “Leave him be.”  Lucy got out her phone and made a note, showing John.  They had a name for the one in the black top.  “What questions?” John asked.  “There’s so many things,” Lucy murmured.  “That doesn’t surprise me.  This is a time when there are many things in motion.  Everyone with an agenda, concerns, fears.  Intruders, guests…”  “You?”  John paused.  Then he nodded.  “If there are many things you wish to ask, I’d say start with the most important, whatever comes to mind first.”  “Verona and Avery.”  “It’s a good start.”  “I want to have Avery over later, when she’s done hanging out with Zed, Brie, and Jessica.  But could you send some of the cooler goblins her way?  To protect her and make sure she has what she needs?  Which is a whole thing, I know-”  “I can.  I’ll ask the Others to keep an eye out.”  “-and I’m not sure goblins are all trustworthy.”  John nodded.  “Yes.  But to stay on track, Verona?”  “Verona, yeah,” Lucy said.  She thought back to recent arguments and exchanges.  “Can I ask you about boy stuff?”  “Second to Miss, I may be the worst possible individual in Kennet you could ask about romantic things, Lucy,” John said.  “Or as you put it, boy stuff.”  “But you’re a boy,” she whispered, leaning into his arm.  “A man, but… that doesn’t qualify me.”  “You were a boy in the past, right?  In the memories of…?  Is that insensitive?”  “No it isn’t, and yes I was, but the memories are splintered, hidden behind a haze of battlefield smoke in the back corners of my mind.  Would you consider asking the Other who just bit the heads off three raccoons, instead?  Your chances could be better than they are with me.”  “But the fact you aren’t into it might be perfect,” she whispered.  “This is foremost in your mind?”  “Verona and I had a fight, and it’s making stuff harder.”  “Ah, team dynamics,” he said, releasing tension in his body, head, and neck as he said it.  “What happened?”  “She has a boy she sorta likes, but doesn’t… like-like.”  “My experience in this regard is lacking, Lucy, maybe focus on the team dynamic issue?  War didn’t dwell on those memories of love and early romance when she was bringing me into the world or honing me as her blade.”  “It relates, though,” Lucy whispered.  “This boy-”  “Jeremy.  Miss mentioned him,” John replied.  “Yeah.  He loves her.”  John sighed.  “Do you want me to stop?”  “I want to help, I just worry I’d fail you after opening up.  I don’t remember young romance, I’m unarmed.”  “That might be great though because… I don’t think Verona gets it.  I barely get it.  And I just want to talk to someone I trust who won’t blab or make Verona feel uncomfortable.”  John looked away from Musser and the four Others to give Lucy a long look, then turned his attention back to Musser.  “Go on.”  “Thank you,” Lucy whispered.  He nodded.  “I think she likes Jeremy, but it’s a friendship like, and other side stuff I won’t get into… and when he likes her like he really obviously does, and she doesn’t, that’s super unfair, right?”  “It could be.”  “And that’s sorta… Verona?  Like, it’s fundamental to who she is.  She gets into some stuff like art and creative projects and she’s so good at it.  Practice?  Bam, she got it right away.  She’s really smart and great like that.  But there’s other stuff she’s not good at, and she gives up on it so fast.  Don’t get me wrong, she’s one of my top three favorite people, but that can be a hard thing to get along with.  Because we’d get into stuff, like a sailing summer camp, and she had no talent, had no interest, and wouldn’t even try.”  “I find I like group dynamics where everyone has things they execute really well.”  “I do too, but sometimes you get into something and you want your friend to be there with you, and sometimes with Verona it just feels like if she’s not naturally the best at it she’ll kinda just bail… and in the process she never lets you be the best.  You know?”  “And you’re worried this will happen with you and boyfriends?”  John sounded adorably awkward as he asked that.  “I- I-, no.  Not exactly.  But I’ve had stuff I was pretty interested in, like, six out of ten excited for sailing, or seven out of ten for going to a music thing in Swanson.  And it was heartbreaking when she couldn’t get into it with me, you know?  I’d be six or seven out of ten and she’d be zero or one, and that sucked.  She’s unfair like that, a lot.”  “Have you talked to her about this?”  “Kind of.  But my point is… I think Jeremy is twelve out of ten in love with her and she’s one or two out of ten in love with him.  She likes him, but… I’ve felt the six point difference.  What happens to this guy if there’s an eleven point difference, he doesn’t know what’s up and doesn’t know to watch out, and he gets that heartbreak?”  “I don’t know, I’ve repeatedly stated young romance isn’t my field of expertise-”  “Accepted, I won’t hold it against you.”  “But that might be part of being thirteen.  If Miss thinks Jeremy Clifford could’ve stood in for one of you in an alternate assortment of young practitioners, she must think highly of him.  I think he’ll survive some heartbreak.”  “But-” Lucy started.  “But if she tried…”  “It wouldn’t be a friendship with whatever else they’re doing on the side, anymore.”  “But at least, at least maybe they could work out with her and him, and things could be so much better, and we could enjoy boys together like we enjoy the coolest parts of the practice together, bring Avery in when she finds someone, I really want Avery to find someone-”  “You’ve asked?  Earnestly?”  “Verona?”  “Verona.  You’ve brought this up to her?”  “Yeah.”  “She’s very fond of you, Lucy,” John said, glancing over.  “Again, I’m not an expert-”  “Totally understand.”  “-but if she could, I think she would.  For your friendship.”  Lucy held her breath, because breathing past the lump in her throat hurt.  She watched as Musser drew a diagram.  Three of the Others stood at the loose edges of the diagram, while Nova stood close to the man.  “You’re okay at this, John.”  “I’m glad.”  The diagram Musser drew was large, with an eye at the center.  It had math at the edges, making it a celestial diagram.  Turning lines of chalk, geometry and notations into something like a computer program, executing a more complex function.  Dates seemed to be part of it.  It was kind of surprising the man hadn’t noticed them.  The glyph was barely affected.  He acted a bit like he was invincible, and maybe he kind of was.  Or maybe the Others he’d brought with him were strong enough to deal with anything that happened.  Lucy thought of Verona again.  Of Jeremy.  “You know… back when I first met you, Awakening Ritual, you were there in the background…”  “Yeah?”  “Dealt with goblins, you were kinda scary.  Your eyes…”  “Somehow, they’re the first thing many people notice about me.”  “Sad and scary.  Um, they reminded me of my mom’s, in one minute or two where she didn’t realize I was looking.  I hope this isn’t too personal…”  John shook his head.  “But my mom looked that way because a man she loved had turned his back on her and left.  Twelve out of ten love against… zero, basically.  And you…”  “Yalda.”  “Yeah.  Heartbroken in a big way.”  John nodded, small and slow, like he didn’t realize he was doing it.  “Just seeing that, it hit me pretty hard, y’know?  Changed the course of my life.  My perspective.”  “Yeah.”  “I can’t even imagine… I don’t mean to prod at sore spots.”  “It’s nice people think of her.  I’d hate the idea that she was used for something ugly, then promptly forgotten by the rest of the world.  You gave her a chance to talk to me before she was bound.”  “Of course.  I wish I could do more.”  “It’s enough.  But you were saying?  About it changing your life.”  “Seeing that, thinking about that?  Thinking about my mom, facing that big heartbreak?  It hurts me, secondhand.  And I guess- I haven’t put this together until now, but Verona is- I love her, she’s in the top four of my favorite people.  But if she did that to someone, if she was that unfair to Jeremy like I know she can sometimes be, I worry… it’d never end our friendship, it’d take more than that, but what if it changed how I look at her?  What if it didn’t end things but did… hurt things, I guess?”  Musser finished the circle and stood back from it.  “Do we interfere?” Lucy asked.  “Can you interpret the circle?”  “I think it’s augury,” Lucy told John.  “He’s trying to solve the Carmine murder?”  “Or figure out Kennet’s involvement in it.”  “Wait,” John said.  “What you said, about Verona’s actions hurting things.  I think that’s worth talking to her about.”  Lucy nodded.  “Is the worry that Jeremy could get over it and endure the heartbreak, but you couldn’t?”  “It took me a long time to get past Paul.  To sorta forgive him.  I don’t like him, still.  I pity him, I think less of him, but… I’ve forgiven him or I’m forgiving him and I’m doing that for me, and for my mom.  If it was Verona, wouldn’t I feel like I was betraying myself, if I found a way to be okay with her being that sort of person?”  “That’s an entirely different conversation, isn’t it?” John asked.  Lucy frowned, watching Musser.  The glyph wasn’t doing so hot.  Rabbit Killer was wandering this way and that, and every time he came closer, the connection-block glyph got chipped at.  Chaos.  Nothing stable, everything at risk of breaking.  Even best friendships felt wobbly at times.  Her dad dying, Paul, Guilherme.  John.  “We already had that conversation, kind of,” Lucy murmured.  “Did we?”  “I talked to a version of you in a dream, or… not a dream, but a fact-finding ritual.”  “Like Musser is conducting?”  “Different.  But you had a secret.  A deal you made with the Sable?”  “With all three judges.  A long time ago,” John said.  “Yeah,” Lucy breathed the word.  Quiet, she asked, “What the frig, John?”  “I’ve been asked to keep quiet.”  “Because they think I’ll interfere if we know?”  “Something like that.  I think you’ll interfere anyway.”  “What the frig?” she asked.  “Am I going to be mad at you after?”  “I don’t know.  I don’t think so.”  “But you think I’d stop you?”  “You’d try, and you might get hurt.  It’s not as bad as it sounds.  There’s work I need to do that I need the seat for.  I need their help to do it.  Work that extends back to the origins of John Stiles.”  “You killed a lot of soldiers.”  “I…” John paused.  The look in his eyes had changed- she only saw him side-on, because his focus was on Musser and the four familiars Musser had with him, but she could see something deep, dark, and sad in John’s expression.  “Yes.  I did.”  “And that’s why you have to do this?”  “A big part of why.  Old promises I made to myself.”  “I’ve been wrestling with my own promises to myself.  To fight the people who needed to be fought.  To not take being treated badly lying down.  To call out racism.  Except… it’s never that clear, is it?”  “Sometimes it is.  In my case it is.  The promise was made, I can keep it.  It means taking a risk.”  “If we can’t figure out what Maricica, Edith, and Charles had planned, there’s still a chance they spring a trap and destroy you.”  “I hope you can figure it out, then.  Or that whatever they plan is insufficient.”  “I can’t change your mind?  What you’re doing… it can’t wait?”  “If someone else takes the Carmine Throne, it could be centuries before another chance comes up.  I can’t be sure I’d last that long.”  Lucy swallowed.  Musser was talking on the phone.  The crooked, slumping Other that was four children with a long coat and a bowler hat barely managing to stay upright took pictures of the diagram with a smartphone.  “John-” she started.  “If it’s augury, we have an opportunity,” he said. “I’m sorry to interrupt, but I may act soon.  You should run when I do.  I’ll go after him, then cut through the building.  Augury has weaknesses.  You can see past, future, present, but when your gaze is turned to other things, you often have a blind spot.  It was how I killed Alexander.”  The mental image jumped into her mind’s eye, so vivid it could have been here in reality.  She could smell it.  The blood.  The odor of brain, or whatever it was she’d thought was the odor of brain.  Why- why did this always come up when she wanted to ask?  She pushed past it.  “John,” she said, quiet and insistent.  “Couldn’t you take another path?  Couldn’t you… please wait?  Become my familiar.  That takes priority, doesn’t it?  I can give you… I hope it’s seventy or eighty years by my side.  In and around Kennet.”  He looked at her.  She stared into those sad, heartbroken eyes, which so easily held a thousand-yard stare.  For right now, they weren’t staring at some point a thousand yards away.  They looked at her.  “I can try to help with whatever the judges were going to help you with.  If I can’t, then maybe instead of it being a couple centuries it could be a couple centuries minus seventy or eighty years.  And I- we can make sure you’re really well set up for after, protected, so you can last the next while, until you can take the seat and… make it up to the soldiers you killed.  Put them to rest or release them or… whatever it is.”  Musser’s diagram illuminated.  She went on, “I said Verona’s in my top four favorite people.  Avery, my big brother, my mom, and Verona.  But you rate pretty up there, John,” Lucy said.  “I think of who I’d want to be my partner and familiar and you… I can’t think of anyone else that I’d trust to have my back.”  The area around Musser was becoming nighttime, and that area was growing.  Lucy could see snow, and she could see the blood on the ground.  The four legged stain on the ground, that stretched three-quarters of the way around the parking lot, body across the rink, which she could make out, head against the snowbank.  If Musser were to look, he might see the people leaving the building, and he might see her and Verona among them.  He might see Avery.  Were he to follow them, he’d see them go out to get Killaloe Dough or wherever it was they’d gone, wearing snow jackets, toques, and boots, and Miss would approach them.  Starting them on this road.  She’d had no idea she’d be here, begging John not to take the risk of fighting for the Carmine throne, knowing Faerie and other forces were preparing to take it away from him moments later.  “If you hadn’t reminded me of other promises I’d made, just before you asked this, as you asked this, I might’ve jumped to saying yes,” John said.  “It’s a kind offer.”  “Is that a no?” she whispered.  “Let me think on it?  It’s a big decision.”  She nodded.  “Your glyph is breaking, he’s distracted, as is his most dangerous, blood-lusted Other.  I’d like to act while the opportunity is there.”  She nodded.  “I’ll cut through the building.  Retreat around the side. If something happens to me, tell Toadswallow and Miss.”  She reached for her cards, sorted through them, and pulled out some.  “This one, to lock a door after you, slap it on the surface.  And this one, to set a fire.  I know fire doesn’t hurt you.”  “They’re strong, I don’t think it hurts them.”  She put it in his hand.  “Go,” he said.  She turned, and she ducked away.  Past branches of pine needles, past spiderwebs.  Out toward the part of the Arena that faced Kennet, that was in view of traffic.  She used the Sight, peering past the image of the snowbank, and she saw John was hiding in the image, moving slowly, gun drawn.  Musser can catch bullets.  Or do you think he can’t while he’s doing the ritual?  He moved out of her sight.  This is reckless.  You have promises to keep.  For the soldiers you killed.  You said you’d consider being my familiar, she thought.  Her heart throbbed, too high up.  Gunshots made her jump out of her skin.  She ran- not away, but to the side.  To the door.  If he was coming through-  She flipped through her cards and she didn’t find the one she needed.  She flipped through again-  There.  Quality of earth.  She held the card around the outside of her fingers, pinky and thumb holding down the ends, and she punched the doorknob.  It hurt, but the doorknob shattered.  More gunshots.  She hauled the door open.  The rink was still there, plexiglass and boards surrounding it, the building empty and dark.  John hauled open the door, then moved to the side of it.  The four-Others-in-a-bowler-hat came tearing through, knife in hand, and stabbed at John.  He met the knife with his own, slapped the notecard against the door, and- wrong one.  It set a fire.  And the fire did seem to give the others pause.  John wrestled with the Other, who dissolved into four, a coordinated mass of eight arms and eight legs, joined together by clothing that was almost prehensile.  John made it about twenty feet of continuous movement before he hit a wall, banging against boards and plexiglass, pressed back by the Other.  “Get out of here!” John shouted, as a knife slashed him from one corner of his face to the other.  The Other pressed in, pushed by its partners, and it maneuvered, dragging knife down throat, shoulder, arm-  John kicked the Other away, fell, and rolled to his feet, stumbling as he got up.  Lucy backed out of the door.  She looked around, and there weren’t many people around.  It didn’t look like Jabber was acting, but something was up… Musser.  It had to be Musser.  Protecting this area before doing the augury.  She’d use that.  Glamour.  Lucy reached for hers, and she threw down cards at the mouth of the little path around the side of the building.  Light erupted, and in the midst of that light, she made the gestures, to draw out streaks of orange and yellow.  John had already given them the clues-  She painted fire, then she drew it out large, creeping up tree branch.  She did the same at the other side, before Musser could get in his car and drive through.  She had cards for smoke and she built smoke.  She hauled the door open, and saw John running her way, reloading his gun.  “Hold!” she shouted to him.  “Don’t shoot!”  The Other came over ice, crawled over the wall, and leaped in a way no ordinary living things could, grabbing onto the ledge of the stands that arched over the entryway.  She scribbled on partially prepared cards she’d done with Verona.  The first read Failure.  She had wind runes ready.  “One shot in three, two-”  The Other pounced on John.  He leaped, put a leg up, bracing the bottom of his foot against the Other’s chest, and pushed himself out and away.  An arc that threatened to have him land on his neck.  She released the paper.  The wind blew it.  “-One!”  The bullet fired.  The paper zipped to a position where the bullet could catch it, and the bullet drove the paper home.  A paper, marked with the epithet, nailed in with a bullet.  “Second shot in three, two-”  The Other screeched with four mouths.  One of the four threw out a chain.  It caught John by the wrist.  The gun fell out of his hand as spikes inside the manacle dug in.  She released the paper.  “One!”  He drew another gun, firing with his off hand in the same motion he drew it.  Nailing it in with a bullet, right through one’s forehead.  Inferior.  “Third in three…”  A second chain caught John by the other wrist.  Two long adult arms stretched out of the coordinated mass of four Others, and whipped out chain with unnatural strength, hooking it around a light fixture above.  It did the same with another fixture, the other chain.  Arms outstretched to either side, John was heaved ten feet off the ground.  The girl with the surgeon’s mask and a five-foot-long apron on her four foot body leaped out, landing on John, scalpels punching into the tops of his shoulders, which held all his weight.  She began carving.  Blood ran down the length of John’s body to his leg, down from toe to the mat on the floor.  At the far end, Musser, hand at his face, glasses broken, shoved the door open.  Two of his Others were there.  The women.  Lucy’s Sight started going crazy as spirits and echoes began to flow in from behind the young-old woman.  Lucy swung her bag around, grabbed her mask and cloak, and broke into a run.  Toward the most dangerous of the Others.  The two women would have to get around or through the rink.  More glamour.  She had stuff prep-prepared, on cards she’d marked out with images of overlapping foxes and smoke.  She broke herself up into three pieces, darting up walls to the chains, down chains to John.  With teeth she seized the Other that held the scalpels.  Against an Other of four coordinated bodies, five foxes made of smoke became just solid enough to pick her up and push.  All instinct.  All frustrated fury and protective urges.  She wanted John to be her familiar to have someone reliable to protect her, but she also wanted- she wanted to protect that look of heartbreak in his eyes, to make it better, like she could maybe never do for her mom, because that image would stay with her.  The various arms were ready, holding tools.  She knew she had to make these count, delivering the curse wasn’t just about saying something mean three times.  It had to be nailed in with something physical.  It had to escalate, each time.  She couldn’t escalate from a gunshot.  Not really.  But she could kick.  The paper found her foot as her foot became the point by which she expressed her aggression.  The mars sign inside the aggressive connection knot.  And it stuck to her aggressor because the connection sign that made it stick was bigger.  The paper was branded with a curse: A disappointment to yourself and others.  Lucy fell.  She tried to use a rune to break the fall, throwing paper down, but she only sent herself sideways.  It was less than great as runework and practice went, and made her think she’d gainsaid herself in a small way very recently.  Her sideways roll dragged her against prickly rubber mats with gaps for the moisture to drop through, and across grit on the floor.  But it was a landing from a high fall that she’d survived and she’d live with that.  The Other, holding the chains that held John up, advanced, and in the process, pulled on John’s arms.  John kicked at it, but the Other rearranged itself, four coordinated bodies, one insensate with a bullet in its head, and two long muscular arms.  And one paper she’d stuck to it.  The paper hadn’t been nailed in in a way that would bring the curse home, but… she’d put a rune on it to make the words burn.  The letters glowed orange-yellow, and smoke erupted from beneath the paper.  The Other snarled, shaking its head, but it couldn’t shake off the paper.  It tore, scrabbling with fingers, and it let go of John, letting him drop to the ground.  Chains broke like glass.  Muscular hands pulled away the paper, but they couldn’t pull away the mark.  Three papers, three epithets, three means of nailing it in.  Hot lead, hot lead, and hot fire.  The scribbled ‘disappointment’ was burned into the side of one of the four faces, as if she’d used a hot wire pressed against skin.  John picked himself up, and reached for her.  He grabbed a fallen gun, and he shot, bullets punching through glass.  He didn’t aim for Musser, but he aimed for two of the Others.  They fled through the front door.  She slapped a paper against the door.  Maybe Musser could break it, but Musser wouldn’t move as fast as his Others did.  They crossed the street and in the time it took them to do that, the door remained closed.  “Too risky,” she told John.  “There’s no way to face him that isn’t,” John said, one hand at his wounded shoulder, the other holding the gun.  “You should have left me.”  “Sacrificing yourself again?  We’re going to have to work on that,” she told him.  He didn’t reply to that.  They crossed the street and reached trees that would let them safely get to water and shore under the cover of woods.  Her last glance back showed the door opening, Musser emerging.  Weakening one of his better Others, breaking his glasses, that would cost Self to repair.  Or whatever he used to repair implements that weren’t his by right.  Disrupting a ritual that had taken time and energy to put together.  She knew from Alexander and the way Jessica’s ritual had been broken up that these things didn’t tend to allow for redos.  She just wished it hadn’t been so risky.  They escaped, and she set up some more connection block stuff to hamper the pursuit.  Crossing the river would help a lot, especially if that fourfold Abyssal Other she’d just cursed tracked blood, the running water would hopefully block its ability to track John.  John trudged through the water, just to be safe, one hand over his wounded shoulder.  “Are you going to be okay?”  “Yes.  Harm through medical tools takes longer to heal than harm through weapons of War, but… I’ll be fine.”  “I’m- we’re worried about the goblins, John,” she told him.  “We think Bluntmunch and possibly Gashwad are in on the conspiracy.  Playing along, playing distraction, being muscle.”  John turned a sad look her way.  “I’m sorry.  I know you’re friends.”  “We knew from the beginning of this, when we set you to the task, there was a chance our friends could be part of it.  We readied ourselves.”  “Yeah,” she replied, quiet.  “I thought I’d been lucky so far.  I knew Edith but she wasn’t a close friend.  Just… acquaintance and ally.  I didn’t care much for Maricica.  It was always Guilherme I traded war stories with.”  “Yeah.”  “Charles… I didn’t mind.  That one hurt most of the three.  But… the goblins matter more to me than Charles.  We’ve had fun times,” he said.  His voice was a bit hoarse, quiet.  “Bluntmunch?  It wouldn’t surprise me.  Gashwad… I don’t think so.”  “Even for power?  The ability to fight?”  “I don’t think so,” John said.  “If Bluntmunch is in, I don’t think Gashwad is, and if they wanted distraction and muscle… Bluntmunch would be better.”  “And Bluntmunch’s goblins, maybe.  We think Biscuit exonerated herself by accident, and Ramjam is… Ramjam.”  “They do what he says.”  “That fits.  So it’s just Bluntmunch, you think?”  “If I had to guess?  Going by what I know?  Him and those that follow him, varying degrees of complicity.  Some are too dumb or distractable.”  “Why?” Lucy asked.  “Is he that mercenary?”  “It’s not greed, it’s fear.  He’s afraid of Toadswallow and what Toadswallow represents.  He’s used to big meaning better and Toadswallow doesn’t fit with that.  It’s jealousy, worse since Toadswallow became our council leader.”  “Okay,” she said.  “Be careful.  Bluntmunch is big, but he’s not stupid either.  Different kind of intelligence than Toadswallow.”  “Yeah.”  “I think… let me heal, we’ll talk to Toadswallow.  I think his reaction will be similar to mine.”  “Hurt?”  “Hurt, but not overly surprised.  Ah, what a mess,” John grunted.  “There aren’t enough people on our side, and the ones who decide to be our enemies are so hard to budge.”  “Yeah,” she said.  He decided he’d traveled far enough down the water that the blood-tracking Other wouldn’t be able to pursue, and ventured onto shore.  His wound had stopped bleeding and was clotting over.  He sighed, bent down, and washed blood off his hands in the shallow river.  She hung back, giving him space to get sorted out.  When he straightened, there was a look of sadness in his eyes.  He didn’t have many friends, and he’d just found out at least one was willing to sell them all out.  If Bluntmunch was willing to work against Kennet for… greed or fear, or whatever it was, for hatred of Toadswallow or the fact Toadswallow stood against some goblin status quo, it meant Bluntmunch was willing to let John fall victim to whatever the conspirators wanted to do.  Letting him take the throne and then taking it away.  “I can stick around, if you need company, a friend, or-”  “No,” John said, and it was firm, leaving no room for doubt.  “Go, do what you need to do.”  “I want to be your ally and friend here, especially after-”  He shook his head.  She’d offered the familiar bond.  She’d made her argument, planned ahead of time, most of it, anyway.  Him saying no to her assistance and company now felt like it was basically an answer to that question, even if he’d pledged to think about it.  “Yeah,” she said, feeling a bit of that heartbreak she’d been talking about.  “Thanks for… talking, and working things out regarding the tricky goblin stuff, and, heh, for tolerating the boy talk.”  She gave him a small smile.  “Anytime,” he said, smiling back, giving his shoulder a rub with a hand and then an experimental rolling movement, as if to check the severity of the damage.  “Even after this week, if we can make it through.”  There were two ways to interpret that.  That she’d have seventy years with him.  Or that he’d be there to talk to, even sitting on the Carmine Throne.  Seeing him realize what he’d said and seem to almost regret it, she knew which it was.  “Sure,” she told him.

      "               <Document: {'content': '    Lucy couldn’t get her head away from her fight with Logan, years ago.  It was a weird thing to dwell on, but it kept poking at her subconscious, her thoughts turning back to it.  She would have thought it was Charles’ doing, somehow, but she knew herself too well to accept that.  And she knew part of the reason for it.  The same Logan that was in her class now had been in her class most years and for whatever reason (she knew the reason) he’d picked her to pick on, her to go after, her to make jokes about, constantly.  He was the class clown, friend of the various guys that mattered for most years, like George, Amadeus, and the donkeys.  When the music teacher had been motioning for them to start and he’d blown on his recorder too early, she’d asked “What note was that?” and he’d responded “a Logan note.”  The class had laughed.  He’d joked once that Amadeus looked Asian when he laughed, with the way his eyes squinted together, which had made Amadeus laugh, which had gotten the entire class laughing in a loop that had people falling out of their seats, or pretending to.  Most recently, he’d made a big deal about getting Pam in the spin the bottle game back at the end of semester party.  That hadn’t gotten as many laughs.  Lucy had stood up for Pam, best she could, because she’d been there.  He hadn’t gotten laughs going after Lucy either, but nobody had stood up for her, except Verona, and Verona hadn’t been as on the ball back then.  Other things going on.  Who farted?  Because Lucy has a look on her face like someone farted.  Only a few laughs.  So he’d taken another tack, repeating it.  Trying to make it a running joke, to get a few more laughs each time.  Refuge in audacity.  Days later?  Still got that look on your face.  Oh, are you trying to get out ahead of the game, with she who smelt it dealt it?  Ha ha ha.  Verona was bringing water over to the parents.  She was using those damn reusable, biodegradable water bottles.  Lucy’s mom had noticed, remembering the call with Verona’s mom.  You look like shit, Logan had told Lucy, unprompted.  He’d said it a few times.  Not usually with more than a few loyal friends around, and even then he hadn’t gotten much of a laugh.  He’d tried that one on a few times.  Really fucking original there, Logan.  Lucy rubbed at her arm.  She felt so uncomfortable in the top she was wearing.  Another thrift-shop loaner from Verona.  It was nice-ish, but it felt like a skin that wasn’t her own.  She didn’t quite remember what had provoked the fight – sometimes she did, but whenever she did, it kind of got overriden in her memory space with the fight itself.  When she’d called him out on it, when she’d finally lost patience, he’d asked her if she wanted to fight, and she’d said yes.  She’d learned a few lessons in that day.  That being outraged and being right didn’t equate to some special reservoir of strength.  Not like in the cartoons and movies.  There had been nothing satisfying about it.  Both of them had just come out of it looking… worse.  It had been a hair-pulling, clothes-pulling, sniveling, awkward-grunt exchange, the occasional punch, feeling like she hurt her own hand more than she did anything to him.  They’d wrestled to the ground, and once he’d realized he could kick at her leg and get her pants to ride down, he’d tried to pants her that way, scraping her calf with the side of his shoe over and over again.  The way her head had been back then chased her.  It wasn’t even the only thing, but she remembered trying to think coherently and pull herself together in the middle of the fight, and getting panic instead.  Panic because her arms weren’t free to hike her pants back up, because she was so certain every mistake she was making would be its own source of running jokes against her, because she wanted him to stop and he wouldn’t.  All that, and, more a feeling that she’d understood thinking about things later than a thought she’d had then, but still a huge part of it: if she couldn’t stop him here, fighting with all she had, what the hell could she do against all the rest of it?  Logan existed in a space where he could pull that shit and get away with it.  But Lucy had tried being nice.  That was the thing.  When she found herself wondering if the way people treated her was because of the way she held herself, criticized things that needed criticizing, and refused to take any shit, she had a response.  She had tried.  She had put in her years, she’d worn shirts with flowers on them, she’d smiled a lot, she’d been nice, she’d been supportive, she’d gotten anxious about birthday gifts bought for classmates, back in the days when everyone got invited to a birthday, because she wanted to do well.  She’d been Pamela O’Neill, Avery’s original crush, with only nice things to say about others.  It hadn’t mattered.  The only person backing her up back then, picking her up off the ground, looking her straight in the eye, while Logan talked shit in the background?  Verona.  Even Pam hadn’t had any words of support, and Pam had- it felt like Pam really should’ve said something.  Logan had picked on Pam too.  She’d tried to change things and then it had all been worse.  Lucy felt now like she’d felt then.  She’d cried, her clothes felt wrong, she hadn’t been able to get this asshole to budge, acting from the heart.  “Done?” Charles asked.  Verona sat on the armrest, passing Lucy some water.  With friends on either side of her, Lucy put the bottle between her thighs.  “Sure.  I guess,” Verona said.  “Once you’re done hydrating, would you be open to a short walk?  It would help us both,” Charles said.  “We’ll leave, loop around after a short while, and return here so you can finish your claim, Verona.”  Verona looked over at Avery, then down at Lucy, who was in the chair.  “Why?” Lucy asked.  “Because it allows me to illustrate certain points, and it will reframe certain things in the context of Kennet and what we’ve all been doing.”  Lucy sighed.  She grabbed the bottle, took a big drink of water, and then put it down on the floor by the chair.  She remained where she was, leaning forward, elbows on her knees, glaring.  “Is that a yes?” Charles asked.  Lucy glanced at her mom, then at Avery’s parents.  “Is it dangerous?” Kelsey asked.  “I’ll protect us.  But we shouldn’t run the risk of running into many of the invaders,” Charles said.  “Verona?  Would you have the door lead us to Kennet below?”  Oh yeah.  They’d kind of skimmed Kennet below with the parents.  Broad strokes were there.  “Door’s open,” Verona said, standing up.  Avery went to the front hall, grabbing her bag as she did, stepping around the bottle Lucy had put down, putting her own down by the wall, there.  Lucy got up.  Her mom kind of intercepted her as they both reached the front hall at the same time, giving her a little hug.  They were blocking Charles and Lucy didn’t care.  Lucy remained very conscious of the necklace, and the unfamiliar black sweater.  “Why Kennet below?” Avery asked.  Charles passed through the doorway, the last of them to leave the Demesne, but where they’d stopped, he kept walking, toward Downtown.  It was night out, and the streetlights of this residential patch had a different hue, with the smoke from the factories in the air.  “Before I complimented Miss on her ability to find such exceptional young children to be Kennet’s practitioners, Avery and Verona were on the money about my intentions.  If Lucy had spoken up as well, I would have been dumbstruck.”  “You don’t deserve me speaking up about your plan,” Lucy said.  That sounded sullen.  It felt sullen.  “I was hoping you’d bring it up nonetheless.  For the benefit of everyone else here.  I know you’ve penned the question in your notes.”  “You’ve been spying on an underage girl?” Lucy’s mom asked.  “No more than you’re spying on someone’s home when you look at a satellite picture of their town.  I have a different kind of awareness, mostly around certain words and actions, as they pertain to practice.  The girls know.  They took their turns at being the Carmine, very briefly, to try to unravel the conspiracy, to try to catch me, Maricica, Edith, and the others.  The question, Lucy?”  “Would you please go fuck yourself?”  “The one you penned in your notebook.”  Lucy sighed again.  “Why make Kennet below?”  “And?”  “And it’s a symptom of the knot,” Lucy said.  “By tying the rule about travel to you to Kennet, you interrupt and turn aside spiritual flows.  But on the day you used Yalda and the hundreds of other people you murdered with the Choir to kill John, you did it really deliberately.  The Arena was trashed, and you made it- you pushed it into the reflection in the puddles.  Put the intact Arena back in Kennet above.”  They were in a position to see the Arena, though trees blocked part of the view.  It looked like there was a big party going on in the parking lot.  The building was still burning, still smoking.  Maybe it would as long as Kennet below lasted.  There was a naked man at the top of what looked like a twenty-foot wooden two-by-four, with the bottom of the wooden beam in a burning trash can that apparently had other stuff welded to it to keep it from tipping over.  He seemed to be trying to keep balanced so that the beam wouldn’t tip over or send him falling to the pavement below.  People around him were shouting, and Lucy’s earring could pick up the words.  Some had sharp sticks, and others were offering to catch him if he made deals with them.  Whatever.  “So what were you doing?” Verona asked.  “Why do this?”  A group of eight or nine year old kids emerged from the shadows.  The biggest girl had a white bandage across her nose, a lit cigarette in her mouth.  All had knives, and all of them looked like they wouldn’t hesitate to use them.  Lucy wasn’t sure if it was because Charles had so much presence or if it was because they recognized her and Verona, but one girl pushed on the arm of the lead girl, whispering.  “Let’s skip this one.”  The leader listened, hesitating a second, as if ego kept her rooted and she had to tear free of those roots.  One little boy lingered even longer, but when his buddies were gone, he spat on the road and then hurried after.  “You’ve written it in your notes.  Others have said it outright.  This is, in a sense, what humanity once was.  Before the Seal.  On the one hand, they are less literate, fiercer, tribalist.  But the Seal doesn’t only empower.  It constrains, limits.  Back in early history, there was more room for the exceptional to emerge on their own.  And there was room for those individuals to grapple with whatever aspects of the practice they needed.  Before it was practice.”  “Just so I can pin down a timeline, what kind of before was this?” Connor asked.  “Bronze age, I’m guessing?” Verona replied.  Lucy nodded.  “Bronze age,” Charles confirmed.  “Before even the written word was easily spread.  Information spread by way of word of mouth and by stories, and we all know how much a single message can mutate, if passed through enough mouths.  It was all mutable.”  “Okay,” Connor replied.  “This is a return to that.  Some differences.  A finger rests on the scales.  But… let’s take someone for example, like Suze,” he said, indicating a young woman sitting in the doorway of an apartment building, pulled in tight against the door, knees to her chest, arms folded, head leaning sideways against the wood.  She had long brown hair.  The woman didn’t seem to notice they were talking about her.  “What about her?” Avery asked.  “Her mother spent nearly every waking minute of the day fawning over Suze’s brother, how strong he was, how smart, how fierce.  Constant.  He could do no wrong in her eyes, and if he wanted something, his mother would go to any lengths to give it to him.  Including theft and muggings.  Including meeting up with a man who disgusted her, who had money.  Including stealing from Suze, who got the scraps of what her brother had, taking all the money Suze had saved up to get a place elsewhere to give her brother a very expensive set of headphones.”  “You put this in motion,” Lucy said.  “You’re responsible for that unhappiness.”  “It’s something that you could find in any town.  There is favoritism and there are parents with blinders on in nearly every neighborhood, even, it’s only a matter of degrees.  This is a distorted reflection of that.”  “Doesn’t really change what I said.”  “May I explain the reason I put it into motion?” Charles asked.  Lucy shrugged.  “Your explanations leave a lot to be desired.”  He met her eyes briefly, then looked back to Suze.  “Suze, hungry, tired, frustrated, and lonely, verbally and financially abused by her family, maddened by the minute-by-minute worship of her brother, made to work and give over her pay as rent to her mother, who spent it on her brother, she snapped, though ‘snap’ does imply something immediate.  She took ten minutes to boil water on the stove with a full bag of sugar inside, and half a bottle of household cleaner.  Then she threw it at her brother.  The sugar made into a kind of tar, and the cleaner made the resulting scarring worse.  Her brother’s upper body and her mother’s hands were affected.”  “What’s the point of this?” Lucy’s mom asked.  “Telling these children a horror story?”  “The point is that Suze, after being forced to run away, is pursued and stalked by her mother.  It’s a game of cat and mouse, with Suze attempting to sneak home and get past her brother to retrieve her things, her mother alternating between a night and day hunt for Suze and care of Suze’s brother.  One small dynamic at play here.”  “Failing to see the point,” Lucy’s mom said.  “Suze can’t sleep.  Her mother hires thugs to look for her, or will appear wherever Suze has taken to resting.  She has to look out for opportunities, patterns, searches the trash in case her things are thrown out.  She doesn’t have much, and she badly wants to hold onto that little amount.”  Verona reached into her bag, and pulled out papers.  She sorted through them, then left their group, approaching the twenty-ish year old woman in the doorway.  Suze stirred as Verona approached, grabbing the door handle to pull herself to a standing position, opening the door, and entering the apartment complex as almost one motion.  “It’s okay.  I’m the third witch of Kennet.  Not a threat.”  Suze remained there, edge of the door pressed against the middle of her chest and stomach, ready to slip through.  Her head moved weird- like she was fighting to avoid falling asleep, even as alarm churned through her.  “Pass.  To enter Kennet found.  Wear a mask.  You can’t really hurt anyone, but… be good.  You’ll be able to sleep, no threat.  It’ll let you get your head sharp.  If you can’t find a way to get your stuff, talk to me.  I’ll be around tomorrow afternoon.”  Verona inched forward.  The moment the paper was close enough to grab, Suze took it, then disappeared inside, slamming the door.  Lucy’s earring let her catch the running footsteps, the slam of the door on the far side of the building, as Suze escaped out the back.  Verona came back.  “And that,” Charles said, “is a large part of why I wanted to talk to you.  We’re at odds.”  “You think?” Lucy asked.  “May I finish what I was saying?” he asked.  “Suze was on her way to becoming something special.  Every time she’s alerted and runs, the stress response is longer lasting, it gives her a little more for more time.  She’s already ceased to sleep, but as she twisted and knotted internally, she was gradually approaching a state where she’ll be running on a stress high every minute of the day… and even finding and entering a special second tier that exists when she’s always on the alert and something calls for a special stress response.  Eventually, if she lived and continued on that course, there would be a third.  In the process, she taps into something visceral.  If she goes to the right places, deals with the right goblins, the right bogeymen, if she draws in spirits, then she’ll adapt faster.”  “That sounds horrible,” Lucy’s mom said.  “Constant stress.”  “But it empowers her.  It gives her a special set of tools to approach the world.  Her mother has the potential for the same kind of growth.  So does her brother.  So does the young girl who was leading the small gang that briefly stepped into the road ahead of us.  So does the man behind the counter back there.  Mallory, Bracken, Bag, they had or have the potential.”  “It’s part of your plan?” Verona asked.  Lucy glanced around.  There were people who were looking at them, all around them.  They stood in the middle of the road, which wasn’t a big deal because there wasn’t much traffic, and they were the center of attention.  “This isn’t only about practitioners and Others,” Charles explained.  “If it were only about making some big, problematic Others to take over this region, my efforts wouldn’t amount to much.”  Lucy kept looking around.  “You’re going to do it elsewhere?  This?  You’re going to do it in all the Lordships…”  She trailed off, ready to make it a question at the last second if Charles gave any indication she was off tack.  But she was pretty sure-  “That is the intention.”  “This doesn’t look or sound like a very nice place,” Kelsey said.  “On the upside, it doesn’t look like most of the stores close mid-afternoon,” Connor joked.  Kelsey gave him a half smile, as if she wanted to acknowledge the joke, then she looked at Avery.  “You girls have been here a lot?”  “Those guys more than me,” Avery said.  “Most of this has sprung up while I was gone.”  “And you want to spread this out?” Kelsey asked Charles.  “Each Lordship its own instance, with its own ideas and rules.  Again, if it was as simple as a few puzzling monsters, someone like Marie Durocher could storm in, with enough brute power.  Or a clever mind could unravel the trap.  But I’ve looked over Wye Belanger’s shoulders, as he looked at the future.  I’ve kept an ear out for the ongoing discussions between the new Lords and people outside.  Between Raymond Sunshine and people around the world.  I know how this will happen.”  “Getting kind of tired of the prophecies,” Verona said.  Charles smiled a bit, but it was a smile turned surly by the deep lines in his forehead and face.  “I used to be friends with Alexander.  I know the feeling.  But I’ll tell you now, there will be an initial reprisal, without enough information.  Favors called in.  Aimed at me.  It’ll happen over the next few weeks and months.  Some will succeed, others will fail, but the ones they remove will be replaced soon enough, as sleeping Others rouse and act.  Then they’ll notice the people.”  Charles extended a hand, red hair on the back of it, dark lines in the grooves and marking out the lines, like he’d gotten ink on it and only rubbed the surface level of it off.  Toward the people on the street.  One of those people, an old woman, cupped a breast that drooped to her pelvis, and gave him the finger with a trembling hand.  The look on her face made it look like she could spit bile and venom.  Maybe she could, if she was out at night and nobody was really bothering her.  Lucy hoped the Oldbodies weren’t adding more people to their ranks.  “So you plan to fill the province with enough of these people to… what?”  “You’ve seen the people from the Lighthouse,” Charles said.  “You’ve seen the people Larry Bristow sent to Kennet.  Clementine, Daniel, Sharon?”  “They weren’t in the notes,” Lucy’s mom murmured.  “They’re in another book,” Lucy replied, quiet.  “I’ll get you that later.  They’re…”  “They’re wrecking balls.  They disrupt what practitioners build.  They fight Others.  Toadswallow has mentioned the cat lady?  The boy with the improvised traps, after he glimpsed a goblin?  The-”  “He’s mentioned the cat lady,” Lucy interrupted.  “Bit of a surprise obstacle for any goblins up to mischief.”  “Or a target, if they want to do something silly,” Verona added.  “Yeah.”  “Same idea.  Wrecking balls and pitfalls.  I like to see that kind of Awareness as the world straining, fighting-” he clenched a fist for emphasis.  “-fighting, climbing that wall that is the Seal, to get what it needs to the other side.  Antibodies.  A natural response.  A few humans, as they used to be.”  Antibodies.  Humans like they were in the bronze age.  Aware all over the place.  “To what?  Slow them down?  Mess them up?”  “They’ll be wary, after the first few traps.  Then they’ll catch first wind of the rise of this population of Aware and Knotted.  Hesitation becomes a halt.  A halt becomes a hiatus.  A hiatus becomes a question.  What’s the benefit?  What do they gain by trying?  A tract of wilderness?”  “Toronto?” Avery asked.  “That was apparently a big deal.”  “Say someone retakes Toronto.  What do they gain, except problems?  New problematic Others, sometimes one a month, sometimes two a week, all looking to be Lords, pulled there like… like gravity drawing drops of blood to the lowest point in a bowl.  And in the population, countless troublesome people mingling with the population, with abilities and resistances that put them contrary to conventional practice.”  “And everyone else?” Kelsey asked.  “People like this, who’d throw boiling water on their brother out of resentment?  Children with knives and cigarettes?  What happens to the Ontario we know?”  “Part of Ontario, part of Manitoba.  Different borders,” Charles replied.  “Whatever.  What happens?”  “The news media will find ways to explain it away.  A failure in the police, a question of leadership, employment levels, costs of living.  Some explanation for riots, insurgency, rising crime rates.”  “That’s not what she’s asking,” Lucy’s mom said.  “How many people get hurt?”  “Too many.  But the alternative is worse.  The alternative where the Belangers wound, maim, and use omens to spy, even knowing those omens may cause bad things to happen.  Like Melissa Oakham falling and snapping her foot off.  An alternative where Bristow enslaves and keeps people, uses them-”  “Like you’re doing with the Aware?” Lucy asked.  “I won’t enslave or keep them.  They’re free to do as they wish, and enough of them will wish to get in the way or push back that it’ll work.  What I’m saying-”  “What if we’re done hearing what you’re saying?” Lucy asked.  “Will you change your mind?  Is there anything I can say that’ll change your mind?  Verona?”  “I dunno,” Verona murmured.  “Avery?  Anything?  Charles, is there anything Avery can say or offer that’ll change your plans here?”  “It’s already underway,” the Carmine Exile told her.  His breath fogged in the cool evening air.  “I don’t think it’s very fair that you’re pushing all of this expecting us to come meet you in a compromise, when you’re not really budging,” Lucy said.  “It sure is nice of you to tell us your evil plan, though,” Verona said, eyebrows raised.  “It’s not evil,” Charles replied, looking momentarily startled as he said it.  His voice wasn’t a growl, but it still had that burr of a growl to it that came from years and years of being sick, of being tired, of being Forsworn.  “It’s desperate.”  “I think it can be both of those,” Lucy replied.  “You told me not to mince words.  So I won’t.  What Verona just did is hurting both you and it’s getting in my way.  Musser will return.  Kennet will face other threats.  Suze was on her way to becoming someone who could and would push back, who would trip up conventional practice.”  “Suze was a person and it sounds like she was having a hell of a bad time,” Avery said.  “Not saying she should have done what she did, but…”  Lucy folded her arms.  “It’s kind of a dynamic down here.  No law except how much you can defend yourself, everyone out for themselves, freedom.  Minimal support, unless someone sees you’re in trouble and offers help.  Which is usually us.”  Lucy’s mom put a hand on her shoulder, rubbing, and did the same for Verona.  But if she was proud, she was concerned enough for that emotion to override the look of pride in her expression.  “You two have, anyway,” Avery said.  “I haven’t been around.”  Lucy shrugged.  “But she was and is a person,” Avery said, looking up at Charles.  “Franky Reiber is a person, and she- is she going to be okay, when you use her to make a trap?  After she or her goat or whatever you’re doing makes her the focus of Thunder Bay?”  “In the city of Peterborough, there is a practitioner with the family name Allaire.  He’s a community organizer in Stanground, the only positive voice some youth have heard in their lives.  He does cleanup events every other weekend, picking up trash, maintains a group of twenty teenagers who go with him on weekends to various charity services, another ten who show up only sometimes.  But sometimes he’ll let them know there’s a tough stint in an old folks home, or something unpleasant, and instead he’ll take them to waterparks, or skating.  He rewards them with pizza, shawarma, burgers.  For some, again, it’s all they get.  Some of the funds for those trips and food come from community donations, some places let him and the kids eat for free once a month.  But mostly he pays out of pocket.  Family money.”  “That’s great,” Kelsey said.  “But?”  “He recently took an apprentice.  One promising young lady who attended every weekend, because she was homeless.  She showered at school, had a teacher do her laundry.  She was resourceful, smart, eager, and was working with plans to go to university in two years.  She was his thirteenth apprentice.”  “What happened to the other twelve?” Connor asked.  Charles’ voice took on that growl again.  “The same thing that happened to the thirteenth.  He forswore them all.  And he keeps them.  He gives them sanctuary knowing if they ever leave they’ll have to return before long, because what the world will do to a forsworn person is worse than being his servant.”  “Doesn’t the Seal prevent that?” Verona asked.  “You take on responsibility.”  “It should, and he should.  Just as Musser can say he’s won enough times he should be able to cry precedent and win this time, skip the trivial parts, Mr. Allaire claims he and his family have the right, because that’s their pattern.  His mother did it before him, and his son and daughter will do it after him.  Pillars of the community.”  Lucy gripped the sleeve of her sweater.  “So because bad things are happening, that excuses-”  “I see it all,” Charles replied.  His eyes were sad.  “You’ve been Carmine, even if it was only for a short time.  Thirteen individuals, four more that were Forsworn by the mother.  Allaire’s daughter did the Awakening ritual last year and has plans to paint a scenario, where she’ll ‘accidentally’, quote unquote, reveal magic to a classmate.  She aims to lure her in with that, then awaken her, then forswear her, and she’ll have a handmaid for life.  Seth Belanger, you know him, forsworn by his guardian.  Another man is out there, who was forsworn by Alexander.  A friend sometimes, an enemy at other times.  He was an enemy at the wrong time.”  “A lot of people are forsworn, okay,” Lucy said, “but-”  “Let me finish.  Because many of these people, they aren’t seen.  They aren’t recognized.  A Lord took over Peterborough just before Musser came here.  They shook Allaire’s hand and agreed to work with him, and I don’t think they’ll ever realize on their own, but if they do, I’m not confident they’ll care enough to act on it.  Thirteen under Allaire.  Four still alive, Forsworn by his departed mother.  One, soon to be, under the child.  Seth Belanger.  Griffin Lytle, forsworn by Alexander, far worse off than I ever was, he’s in the deep woods, barely holding on to humanity.  There are five more, and those are just the ones who’ve survived this long.  Joel Richardson, Lenard Lily, Yiyun Jen, Josef Miller, Helen Kim.”  “That’s a lot,” Avery said.  “That’s terrible.”  “I stand where I stand, and these people aren’t really in my jurisdiction.  The other Judges are meant to keep an eye on them, for varying reasons.  I’m meant to oversee the act of Forswearing.  But I still see them.  I see what’s in the region, and I can and do the equivalent of looking them in the eye, every moment.  I could change the subject away from Forswearing and tell you of the horrible things practitioners are doing without stopping until Christmas comes.  Some of those practitioners are in this town.  Others are like Allaire, too small to matter, but dangerous enough to ruin lives.”  Lucy felt her mom’s hand tighten on her shoulder.  “Then fix that,” Lucy told him.  “I will, but I have a lot to do before I can.  I won’t outline that part of my so-called evil plan to you, not here and not now.”  “Because it’s shitty?” Lucy pressed him.  She unfolded her arms.  “Because it’s so bad you’d spoil your argument?”  “Because you’re clearly against me.  If you won’t accept what I’m doing, I have to worry you’ll get in the way of me helping those forsworn, even if it means sealing their fates.”  “That’s not us,” Verona said.  “I mean, I’m way less empathetic than these guys, and I don’t see myself doing that.”  You’re more empathetic than you think, Lucy thought.  “Kind of surprised you haven’t done it already, Charles.”  “No comment,” Charles said.  He let out a heavy sigh.  “I’m desperate.  This has to change.  I hoped I could approach you, and call for another truce.  Keep Kennet above, Kennet below, and your Kennet found separate.  Don’t rescue the people here.  Let them find their own strength.  Then if they’re inclined, which many are, let them turn that strength against our mutual enemies.  For Griffin Lytle, it’s a question of life or death.  If you say no, if you refuse, Griffin dies as a result.  For Yiyun Jen, depending on her fortune, it might be the same.”  “Hold on,” Connor said.  “You’re threatening to kill?  And you’re using that-”  “I’m not threatening to kill.  There are things I can do and there are things I cannot.  I have certain reserves of power, I have certain ways of replenishing it.  If you interfere now, you slow me down, but you don’t stop me.  Griffin dies, Musser gets a small edge, and then I carry on doing what I was doing.  That’s the only meaningful decision.”  “That sounds like it’s on you, not us, and you’re an asshole for trying to make it our problem,” Lucy told him.  “The Forsworn are near and dear to my heart.  I don’t pretend to be a good person.  I may only care because I was Forsworn, but I care.  I’m selfish and I’m desperate.  With how much this matters to me, if there was another way, I would find it.”  “Running on empty, Chuck?” Verona asked.  “I have a lot to do and a careful balance to strike to get there.  Now, if you don’t get out of my way, then people who don’t deserve it, and perhaps some that do, they’ll suffer.”  “What the fuck are you putting on these kids’ shoulders?” Lucy’s mom asked.  “Reality.  As Lucy likes to stress, they’re teenagers, and that means an unhappy, sometimes unwieldy mess of childhood goofiness and the crushing weight of adult responsibility.”  “Not for you,” Lucy’s mom said.  “That’s for me to guide them into.  Trusted teachers.”  “And untrustworthy ones, and people your daughter will meet on the street, and those she’ll run into on a first job.  You know that well enough, through Booker.”  “Don’t talk about my brother,” Lucy said, words coming too fast, with a note of alarm.  Charles raised a hand.  Black in the creases.  Maybe dried blood.  Fingernails a bit too long and uneven.  Motioning for her to ease down.  She fucking eased up, drawing in a breath, ready to go on the offensive.  Being shushed, essentially?  Fuck that.  Especially from fucking him.  “I won’t touch or involve Booker.  Or your mother,” Charles said, looking aside.  “No more than they involve themselves, anyway.”  Lucy didn’t ease down, even with that.  “Come on,” Charles said.  He turned and started walking.  “Matthew is this way.”  “Matthew?” Verona asked.  “On a routine patrol.  Let’s get this awkward moment out of the way.”  “What you were talking about before,” Connor said.  “I’ve said what I needed to say.  I can’t see the future, I’ll have to leave it to you and those girls to decide.  I gave you a concession, letting the Garricks take people away.  I’ve given Verona time, in case Musser returns.  I’ve given Avery information about Franky.  I’m asking for assistance here, for something that serves us both,” Charles told them.  “But if we accept this concession now, what’s to say you won’t just ask us to make the same concession next time?” Lucy asked, walking fast to keep up.  “For one thing, there shouldn’t be twenty-five forsworn next time,” Charles said, without slowing.  His breath fogged around his head.  “And if there are, they’ll be a new twenty-five.  I’d hope you’re human enough to recognize that those twenty-five will likely need rescuing too.”  “Weren’t you talking about forswearing people?” Verona asked.  “If I must.  I wouldn’t stab this metaphorical child in the foot, but I’d cut the leg off if it’d save their life,” Charles said.  “I’ll act against those who’d hurt us all.”  “Sure sounds like you’re planning a lot of amputation.”  “Do you fault me?” Charles asked, more growl than before.  His back to them, his stride fast and fierce enough to put him ten feet ahead of the group, he raised a hand.  Maricica made her appearance, descending from a nearby rooftop.  She had no wings but didn’t need them to fly.  Blood splashed up where she touched road, and there hadn’t been blood pooling there before.  “Jesus,” Connor said.  “Different religion,” Maricica said, before turning to smile at him.  “Maricica,” Charles said, not even fazed by her arrival.  “Where is Edith?”  Maricica revealed a candle, then blew.  The air ignited, the flame spread, and wax splattered on the ground.  Wax gave form, and flame gave heat while forming into the shape of the spirit.  Big, candle across the shoulders, shorter than it had once been, almost a mirror to Maricica in how she had drippings all over her, but it was white wax and not blood.  Orange, burning eyes glared at Lucy, her friends, and their parents, before the ‘flesh’ rose up enough to encapsulate her.  Shoulders drew together, head ducked down, and she contorted into a position inside Edith’s form.  Wax formed into clothing, or formed clumps that broke off, with clothes beneath where there’d been skin before.  “Do your pleas go unheard, Carmine Exile?”  Maricica had asked it, smiling, floating with toenail tracing the puddle of blood beneath her, dragging faintly on the road occasionally.  She twisted in the air, belly-up momentarily, then crouching, keeping her head at a level with Charles’, even though she was far taller and larger than him.  Edith kept pace.  They spoke in low voices.  “I wouldn’t call them pleas.”  “Your cogent and heartfelt attempts to sway?”  “As Lucy observed, I’m not about to change my mind, this far in.  It’s perhaps unfair to expect the same of them.  I hope they do.  I hope they discuss, but I’ll figure out a way forward either way.  Maybe death is a mercy to Griffin.”  “And the other one?  I’ve let myself forget.”  Lucy’s mom touched her shoulder, squeezing.  “So that’s-”  Lucy pressed a finger to her lips, and tilted her head.  She’d missed Charles’ one word response.  Maricica was next to speak.  “My head is full of blood and violence.”  “Then you’d better leave as soon as you can manage, without causing a stir.  Her name was Yiyun Jen.”  “Of course, and of course.  Oh, poor Carmine Exile.  I’m sorry this hasn’t gone as you hoped.”  “It’s fine.  Edith?”  “What?”  “How are you today?”  “Worried.  Hopeful.  Matthew will hate this, but… inroads?”  “Better you ask Maricica that than ask me.”  Edith didn’t ask Maricica.  Lucy moved her finger away from her lips, then looked up at her mom.  “So that’s Edith.  And we’re going to see Matthew?”  “Yes.”  “Okay.  I didn’t think Edith would be that… that was a spectacle.  And everyone acts like it’s normal.”  “It’s one of those things, yeah,” Lucy replied, quiet.  She glanced back, saw Avery at the back of the pack for once, talking to her parents, and Verona on her lonesome.  She reached back, grabbed Verona’s arm, and pulled her forward, to put an arm around Verona’s shoulders.  “Ooh, that’s nice and warm,” Verona said.  She was wearing that sweater that exposed her shoulders.  “Keep it like that.”  “Do you want to borrow my jacket?” Lucy’s mom asked.  “It’s a little big, but…”  “It’s okay,” Verona replied.  “Oh man, I want to talk about all this forever, but…”  “Yeah,” Lucy replied.  The conspirators were ahead.  Just out of earshot.  No longer talking.  “It’s been super lonely, weirdly, with a stream of Foundlings and the occasional annoying practitioner passing through,” Verona said.  “Could really do with a sleepover.  I dunno if you’re up for it, I know it’s a school night, but if you aren’t, and if McCauleigh is staying around, maybe I’ll have her over again?”  “Can she?” Lucy asked her mom.  “Tomorrow night?”  “Yes.  Of course.”  “Cool,” Verona replied.  “Thanks.”  “I feel like- I feel as if we need to talk,” Lucy’s mom said.  “Oh no,” Lucy replied.  “Except I don’t know what to say, what to ask.  Maybe I’ll know by tomorrow night.”  They passed a guy on the sidewalk who had three sets of handcuffs on, plus some stuff at his ankles, and a bike lock extending from the crook of his elbow to the groin area, where the upper leg met the pelvis.  He was inchworming his way forward, huffing.  When he heard them coming, he flipped onto his back, up against the wall, and growled, holding a knife out.  Metal clacked on metal- he had two separate sets of brass knuckles on each hand, with wire extending from them to the cuffs, so he couldn’t remove them.  It looked like it made holding the knife hard.  A lock like Lucy or anyone in the high school might’ve used for their lockers, except with a bit more of a metal loop was in his face.  It extended up through the floor of his mouth, through a hole in the tongue, and out the front.  “Do you need help?” Avery called out.  He shouted something unintelligible, that might’ve been slurs and insults, drool and froth at his mouth and at the little hole in the underside of his jaw, working its way down that lock.  He got agitated, swinging the knife at open air, various shackles limiting his range of movements.  Partially to keep up with Charles, partially because the man didn’t seem to want saving, they left him behind.  There was a group of people all holding candles at a tiny church on one corner – tiny enough it wasn’t even that church-y – more a cross tacked onto a small store with apartments above it.  A pastor with blood on his white collar was holding both hands up like he was under arrest as he preached.  Each palm had an ‘x’ carved into it, blood caking the long black sleeves..  Maybe a cross, but the angle was wrong.  The candles burned brighter as Edith passed by.  It made shadows behind the bloody pastor sharp enough to make out, swaying and dancing for a brief moment as the wind passed.  “This is scary,” Lucy’s mom said.  “This is his,” Lucy replied.  “As much as we’ve tried to make parts of it better.”  And as they got to the north end of downtown, Lucy saw the market.  The stalls were mostly closed.  Matthew was there, talking to one of the Bitter Street Witch’s brothers.  “Go.”  “You sure?  Need me to alert anyone?”  “Don’t think so.  But go.”  “Matthew Moss,” Charles said, as he approached.  His voice carried.  “Charles Abrams, Carmine Exile.  And company,” Matthew said, dry, almost disappointed.  “My night just got worse.  Girls.  Parents.  I hope he hasn’t convinced you of anything.”  “Not really,” Lucy replied.  “Don’t think so, anyway.”  Matthew nodded.  “Hello, Matthew,” Edith said.  Matthew glanced at Edith, then looked away.  He kept his voice level.  “Charles.  You spoiled things with the Garricks.”  “I’ve offered the girls a compromise that will let them get the Garricks out.  But the Garricks can’t be doing business here over the long term.  Not as couriers.”  Matthew’s expression didn’t change.  He looked at Verona, then Lucy, then Avery.  “Do you know why I’m here?”  “I don’t.”  “I know the Garricks are anxiously waiting.  I’ll free the others to go where they need to go, but I thought it would be fairest if there are witnesses.  Edith would have to be here, and the girls being here means there’s more of a balance.”  “Witnesses for what?”  “Matthew, you successfully sought and maintained a Demesne claim.  The house is yours.”  “It damn well better be.”  “But you managed that fight by drawing on a connection.  A longstanding, intricate one.  You shared in something of Edith James, and she drew on her connection to you for strength.”  “Ahhh,” Matthew said.  “I see.”  “How in the bullshit did she draw on Matthew?” Lucy asked.  Edith wheeled on her, her eyes burning brighter than before.  “Mind your business.”  “This is our business,” Verona said.  “We’re guardians of Kennet, and Matthew is of Kennet, and yeah, what Lucy asked.  That’s not how this connection works, is it?”  “Edith James drew on an emotional tie to Matthew, for the strength to continue fighting against shit odds.  There are rituals that involve fighting, violence, and sacrifice that are less significant than her fight that night,” Charles answered.  “She drew heavily on that tie.  I’m going to rule as Judge that it fits.  He draws on power from the Doom, which was supplied by her, she draws on heart, a fervent, sustained desire.”  Matthew snorted his nose loudly.  “It’s not funny,” Edith told him.  “You’re an ass, Charles, and this is a sham,” Matthew said.  “You’ve undergone one binding ritual, marriage.  A second point of reference.”  “I’m sure you’ve got a third.”  “And you’ve been living together for a time, in close proximity.  All three of those things are tied to the property claimed as a Demesne.”  Matthew nodded.  “This sounds like common law marriage,” Connor spoke up.  “Common law familiarship, let’s call it,” Charles said.  “Sui iuris, by habit and repute.”  Matthew snorted again.  “Fuck you.   No words were said, no deals made.”  “But each party offered and gave to the others, and each has an inextricable relationship to the property,” Charles said.  “It’s done, Matthew.  If you wish to appeal, seek one of the other Judges.  Or me, if you wish, but I’ll be busy.”  “What does that mean?” Avery asked.  “It means that for all intents and purposes, as far as this Demesne is considered, and only for that purpose, Edith James is effectively Matthew Moss’s familiar,” Charles said.  “With all rights he has, with a small share of the influence.  It’s customary that the familiar gets space of her own.”  Matthew didn’t reply, his expression hard.  This is gross.  This is gross.  This is gross, Lucy thought.  “We’ll talk, okay?” Edith said.  “Tonight?”  “Will we?” Matthew asked, voice low.  He had a thumb hooked into his pocket and the hand clenched into a fist.  “A compromise?  It’s fine if you want to put me in the basement, knowing it’s where you kept me prisoner-”  “It’s complicated,” Verona murmured, to Lucy’s mom.  “-But we’ll cross paths.  There has to be some conversation eventually, right?”  Matthew looked off to one side.  “Charles.”  “Hm?” Charles asked.  “What proportion is usually given to the familiar?  Percentage?”  “One half to one sixth.  And she’d have the run of the space between, to access that subspace.”  “One sixth?” Matthew asked.  “I’ll insist you give her something, one sixth should be fine.”  “Don’t make it sound like we’re pulling your teeth out,” Edith told Matthew.  “Please shut up.”  “We can talk after, like we were doing before.  My family’s been asking questions-”  “I’ll send them a card at Christmas.”  “We should work out a system with the bills, I know you work and I don’t, but we still have the old joint account-”  “I don’t care.  This isn’t your way to reconciling, Edith.”  “I don’t- maybe it’s not possible to reconcile, but it was minutes out of the entire time we were together.  Out of ten good years.”  “Ten years tainted by what happened in those minutes.”  “What am I supposed to do, then?”  “Can I offer you half to shut up for a month?” Matthew asked.  “We can consider that our first interaction of this new dynamic.”  “Matthew,” Lucy said.  “No matter how bad this is, don’t concede.  Don’t give her space.”  “Don’t interfere!” Edith raised her voice, eyes flaring.  “Don’t shout at my daughter,” Lucy’s mom said, hand at Lucy’s shoulder.  A shaking hand.  Lucy put hers over her mom’s.  “Forget the space.  Don’t give her that step forward,” Avery said, insistent.  “A short term gain for a lifelong loss?”  “Do you want to be enemies?” Edith asked them.  Verona laughed.  Charles intervened, stepping between them, eyes on the ground.  “I’m sure this argument could go on for some time.  But I should get these girls to their Demesne claim and the Garricks.”  “So responsible,” Maricica said, smiling.  “Responsible for a lot,” Lucy muttered to herself.  Charles turned.  “Edith?  I did my part for our arrangement.  At least for this sub-part.  Find me after if you need.”  “I expect to be here for a long time.  This is going to be a process,” Edith said.  “Matthew?” Charles said.  “It’s set in stone.  To go against this would be to go against karma.  You’d spark off your own Doom.”  “Imagine that,” Matthew said, his voice so soft as to be inaudible.  “I thought we were friends, once.  As much as was possible.”  “Friends.  Occasionally using me as a carrying case for curses, ailments…”  “You could’ve said no.”  “But it was made clear, I had a debt to pay, for the sanctuary I was given.  It doesn’t matter.  There’s enough happening tonight.  We should talk again.”  “I’m convinced we’re going to, whether I like it or not,” Matthew said.  “Edith?”  “Hm?”  “You have your key?”  She nodded.  “I am excited.  I know my influence won’t be close to yours, but… tonight’s a new night, right?  Fresh start?”  “You poisoned me, Edith.”  “Out of love.”  He snorted.  Edith went to the front door, unlocking it.  The door made it about a quarter inch before banging into something.  Edith turned to look at Matthew.  “A barricade?  Cute.”  “Not a barricade.”  She went around the front of the house to the window, where the curtains were drawn.  She moved a hand, and ignited the curtains.  The moment they’d burned up to the curtain rod, she motioned again.  The fire extinguished as fast as it had appeared.  Inside it was dark.  But it was-  Edith produced a light.  It didn’t help all that much- windows weren’t so great to look through if you were on the side with the light source.  -dark but textured.  Edith backed up, then looked at a second floor window.  She burned that curtain and the sheer drapes too, then extinguished that fire.  “Your mother bought us those drapes,” Matthew said, with a bit of humor in his tone.  “What is that!?” Edith asked.  “Slate,” Matthew said.  “Slate?  Stone?”  Matthew nodded.  “I kind of like it.”  He’d filled the house.  One block of smooth black stone with rough edges, extending through floor, possibly into the basement.  If there was any space left inside, it was a half-inch gap between the stone and the walls or the stone and the windows.  “Solid all the way through?” Avery asked.  “Yep.  Enlisted goblins to help, had them ferry it in, stack it, I made it all into one piece, then expanded it out.  I think facing down as many claims as I did really got the spirits cooperating.”  “Good for you,” Verona said.  “Really nice to hear.  I hope it works the same way with mine, and all the Foundlings.  They’re great, they’re fun, it’s cool, but…”  Edith went back around to the front door, and pressed her hand against it.  She turned her head.  “Good?  Cool?”  “I wish you’d taken the half instead, to shut up,” Matthew said.  “Amounts to pretty much the same thing.  One sixth of nothing?  Half of nothing?  Or there are gaps.  I guess you could squeeze some spirit and wax in there, but it wouldn’t be comfortable.  You can have one sixth of that space.”  “My things?” Edith asked.  “I don’t know where you’d buy a pickaxe, but I imagine that’s where you’d start.  Could even be fun.  Bit of archeology.”  Edith dropped to her knees, hands pressed against the slate.  “Your things?” Verona asked him.  “Moved out a while ago.”  “Good.  Cool.”  “Some of it I’ll miss.  But whatever.”  “Where do I go?” Edith asked.  “Not my problem.”  Edith turned.  “Charles, this is against what you told him to do.”  “Done before any ruling was handed down,” Matthew said.  “I made sure to ask what proportion might be fair.”  Edith climbed to her feet, then went back to the door momentarily, as if to verify it was still there.  “Charles?”  “He’s right.”  “Twist the ruling.  There have to be interpretations.”  “Dangerous words, with a dangerous karmic weight to them.  Asking a Judge to cheat on your behalf?”  “Fuck you, Charles.”  “Talk to me after.”  “I don’t want to talk after.  I want resolution now.  Tonight I was supposed to get Matthew back.”  Matthew scoffed.  With the brightness of Edith’s eyes as she turned toward Matthew, Lucy thought for a second she was attacking him.  White wax tears rolled down her cheeks.  The tips of her eyelashes had an orange spark to them, like tiny flames.  “Maricica.  You said I’d have him.”  “And you did.  For a little while.  You had him in your house, your company, at your mercy, even.  But I didn’t say you’d get to keep him.  That’s up to you.”  Edith looked at everyone present, as if for help.  Lucy made sure to have a good glare on her face for when Edith looked at her.  “So that’s it?  Fuck me?”  “I said we can talk,” Charles said.  “Does that talk get me Matthew back?”  “I don’t think it does.  But you might’ve never really had him for more than a few months, in all honesty.  But we’ll talk.”  “Edith,” Matthew said.  She turned toward him.  Lucy could see the hint of hope in Edith’s eyes, for just that one second.  It stirred up ugly feelings.  It made her think a bit about that useless fight against Logan.  A fight that had left her feeling more like a pig picking herself out of the mud than someone victorious or vindicated.  Edith was in that mud.  “Do you need cab fare to get to your family?  I can make the call.”  “In another town?  Trying to get rid of me?”  “Just offering,” he said.  “I think your wallet and phone were inside.”  Edith turned to the house.  “Then what?” Edith asked.  She sounded lost.  “Then you tell your family you’re kicked out because you poisoned me and manipulated me.  Or lie.  I really don’t care that much.  Maybe come back, talk to Charles, for direction, altering how you’re built, take the hurt away, I dunno.  Maybe just stay away, seems easier and better to me, but I’m biased.”  Edith stared at the house, and the open front door with a black face of rock just inside.  “That block is staying, as long as I can help it.”  “I was and am a broken ghost, spirit instead of a soul, candle instead of an inner light, cobbled together, hidden away inside a broken person,” Edith said.  “Sure,” Matthew said.  “I thought- I thought I was your broken mess.  I thought I at least had that.”  He didn’t reply.  “Played at being human pretty well, I thought.”  “Fooled me,” Matthew replied, quiet.  “I thought this would be it.”  “This is it.”  She ran her hand over her head, and wax came away from her hair in peels and flakes.  Lucy still wasn’t sure if Edith would lash out.  “I, um-” Edith started, halting with the emotion in her voice.  “I’ll take the money to get a cab.”  He got his wallet out.  Then he pulled out a whole mess of bills.  Maybe ten twenties.  She took it, then looked down at it.  “Had all that ready.  You were looking forward to this.”  He looked at the house, then back to her.  “I’ll call the cab.  Wait at the corner there?  End of the block?  In Kennet above?”  “Nothing else to say?  No last words?”  Matthew didn’t reply.  “Alright then.  End of the block, then I’ll move up to Kennet above when nobody’s looking.  I’ll talk to you, Charles,” she said.  “Mmm.”  Edith walked down the sidewalk.  “Wasn’t looking forward to it,” Matthew said, quiet.  “Definitely makes sense,” Avery said.  “Because I thought you’d fuck me over,” Matthew told Charles, finishing the thought.  “I’m not your enemy.  I’m where I need to be.  You’re where you need to be.”  Lucy shook her head.  “But you got where you are by-”  “By means,” Charles interrupted.  “I know.  Let’s not rehash this.  The Garricks are waiting and they’re worried.  Go to them.  Verona?  I’ll let you go.  Or if you’d like, I’ll walk with you.”  “Sure?” Verona suggested.  “How much more awkward can it be than my best friends’ parents walking in with all my naked mural art on the walls?  And ceiling?”  “We’ll come.  No way am I letting you walk off into crimetown in the company of a feral god man without company,” Lucy’s mom said.  She turned to Connor and Kelsey.  “Can you look after Avery?”  Kelsey nodded.  “I’ll come,” Matthew said.  “Bit of backup.”  “Please,” Kelsey said.  “Your name came up a few times.  It’ll be good to talk.”  Avery, standing by Connor and Kelsey, met Lucy’s eyes, as if trying to communicate something with a look.  Lucy wasn’t sure what, but her mom had a hand at her shoulder, and squeezed, and that made Lucy wonder if her mom had gotten what Lucy hadn’t.  Avery then looked at Verona, expression unreadable, who stood next to Charles, expression readable: bitter.  “Wish we weren’t always splitting up,” Avery said.  “Yeah,” Lucy told her.  “Text us?  Especially if you’re traveling in the morning.  Or we’ll reconnect closer to midnight?”  Avery nodded.  “Uh,” Matthew said.  “Before we split, I got word earlier.  We need to have a council meeting about what’s going on with the goblins down here.”  Lucy nodded.  “Talk to Louise?”  “I’m sleeping over there, so yeah.”  “Cool.”  It felt weird, talking about this with the conspirators close.  A faerie or ex-faerie close.  But like, they knew anyway?  Charles was kind of omniscient.  Maricica was first to leave, going to Edith’s side, when Edith really looked like she didn’t want the giant naked blood goddess as company.  Avery went down toward the valley, with Matthew and her parents.  Lucy, her mom, Verona, and Charles walked back toward Verona’s Demesne.  They walked, and it wasn’t a walk with a lot of conversation, which was kind of a nice thing.  It would have felt like they were leaving Avery out.  “Twenty-five forsworn,” Verona mused out loud.  “Yes.  You could consider it twenty-four.  Griffin is pretty far gone.  One Other trying to possess him, another trying to transform him, a tug of war with what’s left of him in the middle.   It’s not so much my aim to twist your arm as it is to hold onto some hope.”  “Pretty horrible fate,” Verona commented.  “And in each case, someone did it to them.”  “Costly, has to be,” Lucy said.  Charles raised eyebrows, looking at her.  “I remember some of the calculus that had to be made, the decisions.”  “Mmm.”  “Costly?” Lucy’s mom asked.  “Bending the interpretations and the rules for twenty-five people, to get them free of being Forsworn.  Takes… political capital?  Power?  Influence?  Whatever you want to call what you get from being a Judge.”  “A bit more to turn it back on the ones who did it to them, in some cases,” Charles growled the words.  “A bit to save Griffin, if he can be saved.”  “Are you bankrupting yourself?” Verona asked.  “No comment.”  “Getting to where you’re pretty vulnerable, and that’s why you’re shy of sharing?”  “This is getting to where you should be very careful, Verona Hayward.  I’ll be honest, some of the Judges are a little sick of your shit.”  “What are you saying to this girl?” Lucy’s mom asked.  He put up a hand.  “If you raise your hand with the intention of shutting me, my daughter, or either of those other two girls down again, I’ll make you regret it.”  He put the hand down, still with the presence of a man who didn’t believe her mom.  “If we agree to any truce, and we do have to talk to Avery about this, will you get anything you’ll use against us?”  “I might gain something.  I’ll agree not to use that something against you,” Charles said.  “I want them free, but it’s hard.  The timing alone- it’s not good timing now, but-”  “Griffin?” Verona asked.  “In another world, if I hadn’t found Kennet, I’d be in his shoes.  I’d hope he’d do the same for me.”  “You’d hope he’d kill hundreds?” Lucy asked.  “Threaten children?  Threaten to orphan children?”  “In his shoes?  In the shoes I was wearing at the time?  I wouldn’t be very picky at all, no.”  Which really said it all.  They dropped Verona off with hugs.  Then when Lucy turned around, Charles was gone.  Lucy led her mom by the hand, through Kennet below.  She knew Avery was really anxious about things, and how it was all presented to her parents.  The Garricks were meant to be something that represented what Avery was shooting for.  And they’d come here instead.  Here, where it was still creepy.  Where people were dangerous.  There was a shopping cart with barbed wire working through it, and a kid in a pillowcase nailed to a window, struggling.  There were Stuck-Arounds-  Who crossed the street, eyes down, when they recognized Lucy.  They went across downtown, over a ways.  And in front of the town hall, which was decrepit, a clear party spot, there was a fountain.  A Dog Tag sitting by the fountain jumped to her feet.  Angel.  “Standing guard?”  “It’s something to do.”  “Okay.”  “And you?”  “Just stopping in,” Lucy said.  Angel nodded.  “I’ll go for a short walk.”  As Angel left, Lucy looked up at the statue of the dogs on top.  “Wish I had my guitar.”  “This is John?”  “I guess.  Memorial.  I negotiated for this with the local city spirit.  Lis.  Who helped Charles.”  “Right.”  Her mom said that like she understood, which she might have, or like she was just getting past the conversation so she could get to where she was rubbing Lucy’s back and giving her a kiss on the top of the head.  “I’m sorry this has been such a nightmare.”  “I’d rather know,” her mom said.  “Not knowing is the nightmare.  Being quietly oblivious.”  “I think Verona was missing having someone with her, today.”  “You think we should call her mom?”  “I’m thinking… Tashlit, maybe.  I really don’t know how her mom would react.  It might be she’s too far away, you know?  Not close enough to any of this?  It’d just… not happen, with innocence and everything.”  Her mom nodded.  “I’m pretty worried about her, actually.”  “Then we’ll focus on that next.  After this.  After-”  There was a whoop in the distance.  Lucy listened, and heard very specific sorts of chatter.  Vulgar chatter.  She grabbed her mom’s arm, then pulled, getting her to where she was out of sight.  There were four gremlins with music players, and more goblins dancing and bouncing as they walked, shoving into one another, in a continual, mostly knee-high mosh pit.  With America at the center.  She’d taken up roost in the old town hall of Kennet below.  She wore a top hat with an arrow through it, and a kind of combination of a suit and post-apocalypse gladiator gear, various things strapped or stapled on, patching it, and added as accessories.  “Hey soldier girl!” America hollered.  Angel, in the distance, broke into a sprint.  The goblins and America chased her.  They were being led away.  Lucy waited until there wasn’t even a straggler of a goblin panting for breath before she relaxed any.  “Okay.”  “Okay?”  “We’re okay.  We owe Angel something.  Not sure what she likes.”  She saw the worry in her mother’s face.  Her mom had said she’d rather know, but the way she’d found out, in the worst moment, with so much stress around all of this?  That was America Tedd’s fault.  Karma hadn’t really doled out any responsibility for that.  Yet.  If Lucy was going to have any say, she had to do it soon, make a statement to the universe, using presentation, timing, coup.  Quietly, deep in thought, thinking again of that fight with Logan, wearing clothes she didn’t feel bulletproof in, worrying about what her mom would think, and worrying about all the complications again, Lucy drew a diagram.  Small.  Holding onto the dangling part of her earring, she passed it through.  Listening on the other side.  No footsteps, no conversation, even distant.  No breathing.  Her mom watched everything.  If her mom had doubted her, if there had been any skeptic in her, then would that have made the practice harder?  She got the bigger diagram done, which was a process of drawing, keeping an eye and ear out for any patrolling goblins, and checking this wasn’t all for nothing if someone happened to bring their dog through on a walk and sit down on a bench for a while.  One series of papers, passed through the small diagram.  Blown as if by wind, they would seek out the nearest light sources on a timer.  One in the first five seconds, one after ten, then one after fifteen, then one after twenty.  Lucy led her mom into the center of the circle, then activated it.  They arrived in darkness.  Near a town center and surrounding area that looked really nice, after the expensive and probably badly spent revitalization of the area.  The partially built fountain stood there, with a soldier at the top.  The last components- an epigraph to be mounted on the central stone bit below the soldier, mainly, they were stacked to one side.  I got this, she thought, touching the stone rim of the fountain.  She looked up at her mom.  So much fear and worry there in the instant before she realized Lucy was looking.  “You okay to walk a bit more?” Lucy asked.  “I work on my feet, I can do it if you can do it.”  Lucy smiled, even though she was aware of the tension in her mom.  All the accumulating worries.  “Where to?”  “Avery, check the thing with the Garricks is going okay.  Then home?”  “I’ll look forward to the home part in particular.”  Lucy nodded.  They walked.  Lucy bit back the tense feeling that came with Charles’ ask, the weight of lives put on her, that they’d avoided talking about, and everything else going on with America, Musser, the invaders.  As much as Avery’s going to hate it, we’ll need to bring in Liberty.  And we gotta make the stakes clear.  America fucked with our families.  There’s karmic responsibility on the line.  If Liberty can’t get her sister to back the fuck off and make amends, then America’s going to find out what’s changed since my fight with Logan.  Back then, didn’t matter I was outraged, didn’t change how the fight went.  It’s why it hurt more when I lost.  Now I can and will turn that outrage into some messed up shit.

      "               <Document: {'content': '    Guilherme exercised inhuman agility to hop up onto a tree that had been bent and nearly broken by the weight of its upper branches.  The tree leaned over heavily, much of the trunk horizontal, the branches draping down to ground.  Guilherme wore the guise of a thirteen year old boy as he stood atop it, wearing a kind of kilt over simple homespun pants.  Rather than a grid-based stitch, the white fabric looked like overlapping stars.  The same pattern appeared at the top of each foot, in strapping that extended up his calf.  His chest was bare, he glowed instead of sweating, and his hair was Hollywood-rustic, long and unwashed but in a way that looked like a whole team of beauticians had gone out of their way to achieve that look while also making him look spectacular.  Lucy did not glow, and was in fact drenched in sweat.  Her tightly curled locks of her hair had pulled free of her ponytail and kept batting her in the eyes, and the trace sweat on them made her eyes water every time.  She gave him her best disgusted look.  “Focus on what needs to be focused on, Lucy,” Guilherme said, looking down from above.  “Why are you being so intentionally distracting then?”  “Being distracting for you is the most effective tool for honing your senses.  If you can put up with me while learning the lessons you need to learn, it might make the difference in a moment of crisis.”  “Did you drag me out into the outskirts of Kennet to teach me some bizarre lesson?”  “You tell me,” he said.  Then he clasped his hands behind him and tipped backwards off the far side of the near-horizontal tree.  He disappeared from sight, no body or anything falling to the ground on the far side.  She tensed, then pulled her necklace off from around her neck, slipping on the weapon ring.  She pulled the hot lead out of the bottom flap of her bag, where there was a loop she could stow a small, narrow umbrella in.  It stung against her palm, hurting but not doing any real damage.  “Good,” Guilherme’s voice echoed, from no place in particular.  “Why did you draw your weapon?”  “Because you like to attack me unprovoked to see if I’m on guard enough.”  “Hmmm,” he made a noise, noncommittal, the sound rebounding off of trees.  “That’s not the right answer, huh?” she asked, turning around on the spot, studying the environment, searching for hints of Guilherme.  He did sometimes leave her some clues he was around, so she’d be better trained at finding those clues when it came to dealing with less capable foes than a warrior Fae.  But this didn’t feel like one of those moments.  There were a bunch of different things that she needed to think about all at once.  Where was Guilherme?  He wouldn’t hurt her badly, but he wasn’t above bruises, scrapes, and wounding her ego.  If she ended up bruised in a way that she’d have to explain to her mom, then he seemed to think that was a good lesson for her to learn, figuring out what answers to give.  A bit of training in rhetoric and deception to go along with the training in hand-to-hand.  Deciphering his statements and purpose.  Why was she here?  Why had he been so noncommittal?  He’d asked her a question, she’d answered, he hadn’t given her any sign he liked her answer.  Was she wrong?  Did telling her that she was wrong risk giving something away, like Edith refusing to even hint at her co-conspirators?  She wasn’t just trying to answer a riddle, but she had to figure out what the riddle was.  She tensed the muscles around her ear, and the earring flexed with her ear.  Her hearing clarified.  He wasn’t giving anything away on that front.  Frig.  She turned on the spot, anticipating a lunge.  “Lucy,” he said, behind her.  She sidestepped, not turning around, because that was what he’d expect her to do.  Turning around on the spot to face him was a surefire way to play into his next move.  At least going off to the left had a fifty-fifty chance of working.  Another option would be to bolt in the direction she was already looking.  If she was already looking, she had the beginnings of a sense of what was there.  Guilherme was there, not far behind where she’d been standing.  He followed her with his head and eyes as she continued moving to one side.  He smiled.  “For today’s lesson, a penalty.”  “What?”  “If I find you at my mercy three times, I’m going to cut off that ponytail.”  “You asshole!” Lucy raised her voice.  “You-”  She turned, because it felt like one of those moments, not just a moment where he would act unexpectedly, but a moment where he’d be able to act and punish or lecture her for being emotional and letting her guard down.  “The hair is off limits!”  “It’s not lasting harm, no blood is shed.”  “I could argue that I’m at your disposal from start to finish so this only counts as one incident.  Then I’d end training sessions forever to be free of the possibility of you getting me at your disposal a third time.”  “You could.  That would be to your detriment, Lucy, and it wouldn’t work.  You’re focusing on the wrong things.”  She tensed, watching, searching for him.  He was raising the stakes, which led to the question of why, why was he doing this, what was this?  Was it an exam, pulling ideas together?  Why here?  What was special about this place?  Her Sight cast the environment in various shades of dark watercolor, blots bleeding out here and there.  About as bloody as Kennet, but they’d traveled for a while south.  They were close to the perimeter, in a spot they hadn’t set up any shrines yet.  Why was it bloody?  Who or what was here?  She jerked, sidestepping, turning in a half-circle.  Felt like another Guilherme moment.  “You’re wasting energy by doing that.  Don’t guess.  Know.”  “I know you’re being a dickbag!  I asked for lower-energy training, because I’m tired.”  “Ideal!  If you’re that tired, then there is less in the way of you taking lessons to heart.”  He laughed, the laugh echoing through the woods.  “There’s less holding me back from trying to kick your ass!”  “Don’t ignore your instincts. They’re better than most.”  She bit her tongue, focusing.  He’d definitely go out of his way to punish her for not taking sound advice or acting in contravention of his advice.  There was a rocky crest to the right, and about thirty paces through the woods would bring her to the shore of the river that was trickling out toward Lake Superior.  There was a bit of a path…  The bloody ground here.  She moved, picking up speed.  If she headed south, would that mean getting away from the blood?  She remained on guard while running.  Guilherme liked the idea of… she had trouble putting words to it.  Adding weight to exercises to make it easier to build strength.  But it wasn’t always weight for the sake of physical strength.  He pressured her instincts to force her to develop them, targeted her alertness, targeted her ability to see through deception by layering deception over deception.  It made every little victory something earned and something lasting but it really made her hate his easy smile in the midst of any session.  If he was distracting her with the duel and threat to her ponytail, he was distracting her from something.  Maybe.  This could be a trick unto itself, and that trick could be its own layer.  The blood continued.  Why?  Was there-  A beam of light stabbing down through the trees tricked her eyes, and Guilherme reached out from the tree beside the beam, tapping one finger on the band that tied her ponytail back.  She twisted, jabbing, and he stepped out of the way, retreating behind her.  “One,” he said.  “You shouldn’t touch a girl’s hair, Guilherme!”  “A good thing I touched the hairband.  When I do make contact the third time, it’ll be with a blade.”  Lucy broke into a run, moving away from him, her senses and earring tuned to hear any movements he might make.  Chasing had to take more effort and that might mean a hint of a sound.  There was more blood on the ground.  There was-  A stirring in bushes.  She grabbed her fox mask, and she’d traced it with glamour, so slapping it into place on her head would cast the glamour out.  She leaped up onto a branch, then subdivided into three shadow foxes, darting up and around a tree.  Guilherme had come after her.  He ascended the tree, white teeth visible between slightly parted lips, his movements fluid, not even grazing branches as he climbed, matching her speed.  She leaped from a branch, then cast off the fox glamour, becoming smoke instead.  Weaving through branches-  Until branches swayed in a wind that wasn’t there.  Dense, thick, and rough enough to tear through her glamour.  She held onto what she could, even drawing it up around herself as she fell, slowing her descent.  She hit ground, sprawling.  Guilherme was there, standing where she was due to fall.  “What was-”  “Two,” he said, crouching, tapping the hairband.  “What was that?” she asked, rising to her feet.  She scrambled up to her feet and moved away from Guilherme, her eyes on him but her focus on the surroundings.  Bloody ground, the path bending…  Had she somehow landed back in the same spot?  That was weird.  She looked around with Sight, eyes on things, while the background of her focus remained on Guilherme.  Knowing him, he’d probably make the final stroke a sharp and telling lesson, because anything else would be too bitter.  She marked the landmarks, then backed off, keeping her focus on Guilherme.  He remained where he was.  She made it further down the path, then turned.  Guilherme was standing on the far side of her.  The path was looping.  The way up had been a kind of barrier or snarl.  That hadn’t been Guilherme.  She was in the middle of a snare.  He’d chosen this spot for their duel and lesson.  Bloody ground and difficulty in leaving.  “A little lesson on depressions?” she asked Guilherme.  “Not quite,” he said.  She had to be careful of what she asked or what she did.  She was on her last chance.  Stacking up too many wrong guesses, missing too many little lessons he’d already tried to impart on her, it would be cause and justification for that third move on his part.  Fucking with her hair.  She tensed.  The snare worked like knotted places did.  It might even be a tiny knotting.  Where trying to leave wasn’t impossible, but the ways out were steep and complicated.  If there was blood, where was the blood from?  The thought coincided with her ongoing awareness of Guilherme.  The sense of what he was doing and how it all fit together.  He was making himself a nemesis, distracting or contrasting from what she was meant to not just figure out, but fathom.  Something she was meant to take deeply to heart.  That what was here was very dangerous.  She’d walked the thin barely-a-path and she’d kept an eye out.  The only direction she hadn’t looked was-  She looked properly up.  Not up and at the tree, or up and out at the sky.  Branches criss-crossed above the narrow path.  There was a dark patch in the middle, that she could have dismissed as a bird’s nest if she wasn’t as suspicious as she was.  The more Lucy stared using the Sight, the more the criss-crossing branches seemed to expand, the nest filling up more and more of her vision.  Something was inside that nest, and the more she looked at it, the more that something grew, swelling.  It had arms, legs, and body all curled up around one another, and a rounded head of roughly equal size to the rest of it, oversized.  It looked like crude, slapped-together clay in a rough baby shape, with bits of shore mud, twigs, and dry grass sticking out, giving it a very ragged silhouette.  Roots and branches stuck out from around it, extending into the foliage.  Its eyes, closed, opened.  The emptiness behind those eyes were like a vacuum that almost pulled her off of her feet, into the air.  She moved aside, looking around.  Everywhere, there were smaller branches lying against trees, dry growths reaching up trunks or along branches, wisps of grass, and other things that stirred out of sync with the wind.  The longer she wasn’t paying attention to the thing, the more those things seemed to slip out of sight, elude her attention.  She looked back up, focusing.  It opened its mouth, revealing the same emptiness.  This was a thing that twisted the area around it.  It spread itself through environment, it created a snare, and it lurked… she wondered if it was lurking inside a twist of physical space.  Like spitting unchewable, unswallowable gristle into a napkin and then twisting up that napkin into a bulb.  That might be why it had a creeping, fishbowl effect on her field of vision when she stared at it, if that was why her awareness of its influence was so specific to her keeping her gaze around where it was.  She took a few quick steps to the side, moving out of Guilherme’s way as he stepped out of the trees, looking up.  “What are you going to do about it?” Guilherme asked.  “Is it dangerous?  Can we bring it on board?”  “That’s a good set of questions to ask,” he said, not supplying the answer.  To her Sight, the nest that cradled the thing was festooned with wooden spikes with ribbons tied to the end, and bones scraped down to have sharp edges, and stone blades with the sort of edges that could form if stones were struck together.  The staining was near-black.  The longer she stared, the more it expanded in her vision.  She’d thought at first it was roughly her size but she was getting the sense now that it was much, much bigger.  She started to realize that the width of it and its nest might be enough to take up the entire sky above this patch of path.  When she’d been scaling up the tree, taking flight, the branch had stopped her.  The creature’s mouth opened wider.  That weightless, awful feeling swelled.  Like standing on a bridge above a serious drop, no railing, feeling the lack of solid ground in front of her.  The amount of empty space behind that mouth, even though it didn’t look like that wide a gap- it had that kind of effect.  “Spirits and echoes often cleave together,” Guilherme said.  “But they’re fought in very different ways.  The goblins have complained about the recent influx, and I tried to offer my advice.”  “I’m guessing that was fruitless,” Lucy said.  “It was.  Echoes are memories.  You can contradict them, facing them directly.”  “Yep.  Been doing that.  Gotta disrupt the scene.  Lunging in to stab ’em does that.”  “Crude, but a good starting point.  Spirits are different.  Spirits are barely rooted in our reality.  They’re ideas and concepts.  Trying to meet a spirit risks meeting it on its terms.  But if you stay grounded, find what tethers it, or catch it at a moment it doesn’t have application…”  “I’ve been using my arena.  My arena, my terms.”  “That will work until it doesn’t.”  The light was fading, as the creature grew, expanding its influence.  Her earring picked up the creaking of swelling, growing wood and plant life, the rasp of dry grass and thin vines snaking their way up and around foliage.  The gaps between trees slowly but steadily shrank, the amount of light shining through the branches overhead narrowing down, from wide, diffuse beams to focused, sharp ones that cast long shadows.  More plant life took the shadows.  “I’m not sure I get an echo or spirit vibe from this thing.”  “You’ll want to be sure.”  “You’re talking about angles to attack from, and I’m thinking…”  “Don’t think, do.”  Lucy gave Guilherme an annoyed look.  “Don’t pout.  Do.”  “It’s not pouting, it’s me thinking you’re being aggravating.  I figured out the riddle, by the way, so you’d better not come after my hair.  Because that’d ruin our relationship.”  “You did, and I won’t.  Focus on the task at hand.  Ask less questions.  The longer you wait, the harder it will be.”  “How on earth did something this big get this far into Kennet?”  “A good question to ask, yes, but you’re asking it in a moment we should be putting questions behind us and pursuing action.”    She took that as her cue to move.  Navigating to the edges of this twisted space with the plant life caging them in, the spaces between the ‘bars’ in the cage narrowing and closing in.  A branch fell from overhead, barring any easy navigation between two trees, but in falling, it somehow didn’t subtract one from the number of branches above.  Grass and vines twined their way up to and around the branch, turning that minor obstruction into a larger barrier.  Not an echo.  She didn’t pick up on the emotional resonance.  Spirit?  But this was meatier than a spirit, and most spirits seemed to float by and be abstract representations of some idea, force, or principle, only occasionally getting strong enough to bring stuff into reality.  “Spirit…” she started, hesitantly, backing away from a drooping bough that was now blocking the narrow path and cutting it in half.  She sensed Guilherme’s disappointment.  “Mixed with elemental?”  “If so, what are you going to do about it?”  Elementals were forces that existed in often brief spans of time.  They were the lightning strike touching earth or torching a tree from the inside out.  They passed when the event did.  Spirits tethered themselves to reality.  Both were making contact.  She drew out a blade from the key at her necklace, then began cutting.  Slashing at the growths that were connecting this elemental spirit to reality-  More branches fell, dropping right on top of her.  She heard the cracks and she heard the rustles, and she hurried out of the way, before resuming cutting.  “This may be where I have to step in,” Guilherme said.  “You’ve found the right answer, and you’ve found it a touch late.  There are other lessons to impart here, but as it stands, you’ll have to focus on cutting for the next thirty minutes to get to the next part of the lesson, and that leaves no room for figuring out the next pivotal step.”  She kept hacking.  “It’s my fault, not yours.  It was a touch stronger than I thought,” Guilherme said.  He pulled a blade out from behind his back, when he hadn’t had a blade strapped to his back.  “For your edification, yes, it’s spiritual, and elemental, but there is a touch of the divine in it as well.  When deities spill their seed it can pave the way for things like this.  A bit of the life-bearing clay given seed enough for life, but nothing to shape it.  And because it’s divine, and because you’re in its realm…”  “Gotta attack it from outside!” Lucy grunted between swings.  She moved out of the way of a bit of wood that plunged from above, broken and forceful enough that it impaled the ground and embedded there.  She tried to catch her breath, and accumulated fatigue made her feel a bit dizzy as she turned.  The effect of the warped space and this thing folding its influence around them, like they were already inside its open mouth all compounded together.  She stumbled.  A bit of wood jabbed the back of her shoulder.  “Yes.  After thirty minutes of cutting, realizing that, and realizing you had to backtrack, find a way out, and then re-enter with an eye to its heart… that’s too much for you right now.  You did say you were tired.”  “Are you going to help?” she asked.  “In a moment.  I’m waiting, observing,” Guilherme said.  He swatted aside a branch that reached out from the right of him, his head facing the great crude figure of dirty clay that was suspended from branches above them.  “There’ll be a gap.”  “If you aren’t wrong about that, like you were about how strong it was.”  “Don’t be graceless, Lucy.”  The Fae way of saying ‘fuck off’.  Lucy grinned, then resumed cutting.  “Any moment now, Guilherme!  And don’t bitch at me about gracelessness, you were going to cut my hair!”  “I wasn’t going to, because you were going to effectively apply my lessons, especially with the motivation that threat provided.”  “You threatened to cut my hair!  I’m going to remember that!”  He sighed, still watching, waiting.  He tensed, backing up a step.  A ragged scream came from above.  There was no gap, and fighting through the non-gap, tearing through branches, was a goblin.  Gashwad’s skin tore as he came from high above and pushed through broken and thorny branches, cutting his way straight down, swearing profusely, and swinging two crude bladed weapons.  “Fuckin’ shit-stained diaper-licking- there you are!”  He hadn’t seen Guilherme or Lucy, but had fixated on the baby.  He screamed, a warcry, but he wasn’t making enough progress to properly finish the warcry as he reached his target.  Instead he got hung up and tangled in branches, struggling, cutting, and swearing.  Lucy glanced at Guilherme, who very pointedly did not look at her, settling the end of his blade in the ground, body language changing by small fractions.  Gashwad carried on, spitting with every invective.  He was the one original goblin from Kennet who hadn’t signed on for Toadswallow’s lessons in teaching kids, and his word wasn’t bound.  He was really going the extra mile here.  “Granny felching, ball-gnawing, fucking shitting sister-humpin’-”  “Gashwad!” Lucy called up.  “Hiiii-aaarrgh!  Hi!  As for you, fuckin’ crooked-dicked, queef jockey, son of a dog molestin’ virgin whore!  Lemme at you!”  “Appreciate the help!” Lucy called up, to rub it in for Guilherme.  “Very badass!  Hero of the moment!”  Gashwad cut branches, then dropped down onto the clay-bodied spirit elemental god baby thing.  He stabbed it, and it made a face, flailing.  He had to fight off branches while repeatedly stabbing and cleaving away bits of it.  “Very impressive!” she called up.  “It would be more impressive if he were doing more than whittling it down,” Guilherme said.  “He could have done it in one blow if he’d aimed it right.”  Lucy turned to her teacher.  “Are you sore, Guilherme?  Are you a sore loser?  You dragged this out, didn’t give answers, you misjudged, as you admitted-“  “You’re enjoying this too much, Lucy, it’s-”  “Inelegant?”  “Very goblin of you.”  “Goblin’s getting crap done,” Lucy said, giving Guilherme her best smug look.  “You lost your moment to show off.  Or to feel good about how well you’d taught me.  To make it up for me and get your moment to show off, I think you’d have to, I dunno, tell me stuff?  Teach me.  What do you think?”  “That would set an ugly precedent.”  “Would it?”  “It would only help to cement in and frame Gashwad’s profane lesson here.  There’s not much to be learned from that, and what little there is would be better taught elsewhere.  That haste can cut through many defenses.  He teaches that, but I’d much rather you take it to heart.”  “That stuff gets old, Guilherme.  It’s because it gets old that Gashwad’s thing works as well as it does.”  “Hmm.”  “-Chicken diddlin’, granddad fiddlin’, wang twiddling- take that!”  Guilherme watched with distaste as he commented, “Is it the time limit that has you so impatient?”  “I think I’m just not the most patient person ever.  The time limit doesn’t help.  What is it, two weeks and two or three days?”  “Two weeks and two days, now, yes.  What do you think would be a better use of your time?”  “Getting the answers so we can apply them.  Getting more power, to make up for what we’re losing.  Securing Kennet, so we don’t destroy it while dismantling the conspiracy.”  Even if Guilherme was involved, she was pretty sure none of this came as a surprise.  “The reason I want you to take things to heart is because it’s one arena where you might win.  In a game of questions and answers, you’re playing against forces who have dedicated far more time than you ever could.  Trying to outpace them would require the kinds of changed labels and abandoned humanity that would ensure you were no longer you.”  Lucy thought of Verona.  “So you’re trying to get me to, what, learn instinct?”  “In the Faerie realm we trade stories of humans, because humans are a short-lived currency to some, a… a book that is only available for a limited time.  Miss that story and you may never get a chance to see it.”  “A limited run of a television series.”  Guilherme gave her an unimpressed look.  “If you wish.  Part of the reason humans are interesting is that they can do the unexpected.  Cutting past the glamour, unraveling the riddles, arriving at the conclusion, victorious.  Not always, but sometimes.  It serves to keep us sharp.  Keen instincts and strength of character can triumph, not only over Fae, but over other forces.”  “Will you surrender!?” Lucy called up to the clay thing. “Sorry, Guil, just want to get in before Gash does too much damage.  Stop stabbing it for a second, Gash!”  Gash paused, panting for breath.  “Will you lend us your aid?  With a few rules for playing nice, we’d ask-”  Wood creaked, and branches reached in, more aggressive than before.  The creature twisted, forcing Gashwad to dance to stay on top of it, and directed a pained, angry expression at Lucy and Guilherme, face contorting more than a face should be able to, the deep void on the other side tugging at the air and making it rumble.  “Guess not,” Lucy said.  She made a gesture at Gashwad, who stabbed the thing in the temple.  Thin, dark mud oozed out as he pulled the blade free.  A stab at the thing’s neck made even more flow.  “If you can grasp what you need to grasp in order to triumph, then filling in the spaces between where you started and where you need to end up will be much easier.  Even that isn’t a guarantee.”  “You’re trying to prepare me for what’s coming at the end of summer.”  “Or beyond it.  We pledged you a long and full life.  This would equip you for one.  If it succeeds.  No guarantees.  Even for an exceptional person with the right ideas in mind, it’s a leap.  The reason Faerie share the tales are because those resolutions are rare.”  “So you’re preparing us?” Lucy asked.  “Plural.  Multiple teenage girls, easily molded, not yet set on our paths?”  “Two teenage girls.  Whatever I might give Verona, besides some easy access to glamour, would only hamper her.”  “Hmm.”  The light was starting to shine through the trees again.  There was a cascade of mud with bones in it from the gut of the creature, as Gashwad did enough damage.  It really wasn’t a fighter.  “I’m mentoring Crooked Rook, and she’s requested that I send you to her.  You negotiated for a meeting the other night.  She suggested she give you two minutes of time in the midst of your shrine building, but I asked her to be more gracious.”  “Ah.  Today?  Now?”  “As soon as you’re ready.”  “I wanted to head home, shower, change, do stuff with my mom, maybe, but I can adjust.  Just me?”  “All three of you.  You could shower and change and then go to Rook, if you count that as getting ready.  She’ll have a messenger waiting for you at the bridge between your homes.”  Lucy reached into her pocket and pulled out her phone, ready to dial the others.  She clicked the button to turn it on, and it turned off immediately, going through the shutdown motion.  Guilherme leaned over.  “Hmm.”  “What happened?  I had a charge.”  “Elementals often run contrary to technology.  Something like this Other would benefit from being able to drain away or shut down your ability to reach out to outside help.  “…Frig.  Can you signal the others?”  “I can go,” Gashwad said.  “I saw a dead thing I want to tell Snowdrop about.  I can go to Avery.”  “Send someone to Verona?” Lucy asked.  Gashwad nodded.  He made his way down the branches, grabbing onto loose bits of the crumbling elemental as they drooped, and then hopped down to ground.  He looked around to get his bearings, then started north.  “Thanks again, you’re a champ!”  Gashwad pumped one fist while moving forward on his other three limbs.  “Ah, goblins,” Guilherme said, exasperated.  “You know he may well get so excited over the dead thing that he forgets the message.”  “That’s the risk.  Goblins who can’t see the forest for the trees and fae who can’t see the trees for the forest, metaphorically.”  “It’s best not to speak of Faerie and Goblins in the same breath.  You could get in trouble, making such odious comparisons.”  “Right.  I don’t think I’m wrong though,” Lucy said, enjoying having a slight upper hand on Guilherme.  “Are you so dissatisfied as that?” he asked.  “Do you think I’m so unaware of trees?”  “The problem with your approach, Guil, is… you live so long, I don’t think you always get the small time frames.  Two weeks and two days?  What if we’re not equipped.  We could have the character or the kernel of whatever but if we don’t have what it takes to see it through…”  “If you don’t?”  “We lose.  We stand to lose a lot.  The Sable Prince said we could be forsworn, if the new Carmine decides to be a dick about interpreting what’s an oath and what constitutes breaking it.  Losing has consequences,” she said.  “Losing is likely,” Guilherme told her.  “I told you, the moments I’m trying to cultivate in you and Avery are rare.”  “But doesn’t believing in victory and holding onto that belief count for something?”  “Not as much in reality as in your televisions and theaters.  Then again, those moments are the province of men, not Fae.  You could be right.”  “It feels like this entire setup with the spirits invading is pulling against that.  Wearing us down, tiring us out, taking up time.”  “Probably intentional.”  “We scored a win with Edith, kind of, and it doesn’t feel like a win.  It feels like losing.  I don’t want that.  I don’t want whatever comes next or whatever comes from the end of summer to be more of that or heaps of that.  And I worry it will.”  “You put a lot of emphasis on that. On not losing.”  Lucy sighed, nodding.  That sounded familiar, even if she couldn’t place it.  Some other stuff he’d said earlier had too.  “What about you, Guilherme?” she asked.  “Do you feel like you’re doing okay?  Holding out?”  “I’d rather not discuss it.”  “Is there something we need to do?  Anything that would help?”  “I’m fine, Lucy.  I still have adventures and tasks I must see to their natural ends.  Don’t make a mountain out of a fairy bluff.”  “And you do realize I’m not letting the hair thing go?  You crossed a line and I’m going to bring it up.”  “Go, Lucy.  Wash, wardrobe, then have your visit with our newcomer.  You traded for it, make the most of it.”  “It’s rude, the hair thing,” she said, as she walked away.  She glanced at the remains of the elemental, which was such a mess it mostly looked like someone had dumped a heap of mud on the trees from above, with some tangles and things draped from some vines and branches, hanging like intestines emptied out of a corpse.  “Don’t touch the hair!”  “Noted.”  She headed home, detouring to the water to wash arms and legs of flecks of mud and clay.  She put everything away and then fixed her ponytail with freshly washed hands while walking, getting those locks of hair that had come free.  Her mom was working, so she went inside, plugged her phone in, showered off the sweat with a quick rinse, changed into something nice and simple, then checked her phone again.  Verona had been with Jeremy?  There was a passing mention of needing to get dressed which… Verona.  What was that girl doing?  Lucy shook her head.  She took a second to sort out Verona’s things, which had scattered across her room.  Avery’s message was simply: Coming.  Gashwad is very excited about some dead raccoon.  She told Avery to bring Snow.  Even if the dead thing was exciting.  The others weren’t close to home, or Verona wasn’t close to Lucy’s home.  Or her own.  She’d gone up near Tashlit’s.  So Lucy took her time, heating a pizza roll and then eating while walking, wearing her bag with one strap so more of her back could get air.  Wallace from last year’s classes was standing by his garage, and the door was open.  The guy was wiping up oily hand with a dirty cloth, as best as he was able while in a sling.  He stood by the car in the garage with its hood open.  No adult in sight.  It felt like a weird scene, the sling, him out of sync with the picture, the nice shirt with a dense graphic of hand-drawn faces crammed in togehter, black lines against white, with black sleeves.  The shirt was already dirty.  He was her first thought when it came to what Lucy had heard Barbie, her grandmother, call towheaded.  Hair that was so blond and fine that it kinda stuck up everywhere.  Gel hadn’t fully succeeded in taming it.  He raised his hand in a wave.  She waved back.  “You can fix cars!?” she asked, calling down the driveway.  “My dad’s showing me stuff!” he called back.  “Cool!” she said.  “Wish it was a little cooler out though!” he called back.  “Yeah, I get you!  Cold weather any day!” she replied.  There was a moment where he didn’t have a response.  It felt like the moment was one where the two of them were very much aware that they’d kissed two times and had been due a third during the spin the bottle shenanigans at the end of school party.  “Haven’t seen you around,” he said, venturing a bit down the driveway.  “Went to a summer school thing, not because I need the extra lessons for regular school, just… learning some neat stuff we wouldn’t at regular school.”  “Oh yeah?  Like what?  Robotics?”  “We made a doll move.  It was really all over the place, though.  The school leadership really fell apart before we left.  We left early.”  “That’s too bad.  Sounds like it was neat while it lasted, though.”  “Yeah!  You do anything?”  “I really wish I had anything to say.  I can’t even find a good movie to watch.”  “Do you watch horror?” she asked.  “My parents restrict that, it sucks,” he said.  She thought about offering to let him watch with her or something but that felt like about fifty giant leaps forward and nah, she wasn’t ready for fifty leaps.  She wasn’t even sure if she was ready for the rest of this halting conversation.  One of the girls had been urging them to spend five minutes in the closet together, which Lucy had been very on the fence about, conflicted between Booker’s rule of just saying yes and a lot of other weirdness, and Avery and Verona not being there in that moment to back her up if that weirdness got super uncomfortably weird and…  Yeah.  She felt like she was obligated to come up with something to say, or find a good way to end the conversation, and she couldn’t do either.  “I was in a sling earlier this summer,” she said, noting his.  “Sucks.”  “It does suck.  But it’s better than the arm braces I had on both arms earlier this summer.  Got overly ambitious with some athletic stuff and overflexed my elbows.”  That’s right, he has joint issues.  Bringing up his disability and crap, dumb dumb dumb Lucy.  What’s wrong with you?  Dumb!  “How’d you hurt yours?” he asked.  “Oh, some dude knocked me over and I hit the ground wrong.  Banged it pretty solidly.”  “What a douche.”  “He was!  Yeah, yeah,” she said.  She’d sorely wished she had brought up Jeremy, who Wallace was friends with, but that was a whole thing and she felt like if she kept the conversation going it would lead to Jeremy and Verona and that would lead to boundary-crossing stuff or weird hints and why did Verona have to have such a weird relationship with that boy?  It made things harder for Lucy here.  She wanted this conversation to be over and she didn’t at the same time.  She couldn’t ignore what the Impulse wraith had reminded her was a thing, about boys and crushes, or the feeling of loss from another wraith that had lost a partner.  She’d thought of Wallace during the implement ritual and had flirted with the idea of spending more time with him.  Wallace’s dad stepped through a door that led directly from garage to house.  He waved at her.  That was excuse enough to end this conversation.  I’ll let you get back to it or something.  Thinking of how very bright that pink, rotating wheel the Wraith had held made her want to jump straight to telling Wallace she owed him a third kiss from the bottle spin.  What even was that?  Why would she want that?  What?  “Do you wanna-” she paused.  Wallace talked over her at the same time.  “Did the guy-?”  “Go ahead,” he said.  “Do you want to go get ice cream at some point?” she asked.  “Another day.  You’re doing this and I’ve got a thing.”  “Are you asking me out on a date?” he asked, in a tone that might’ve been incredulity.  She hadn’t expected that tone, or that kind of question.  She’d been braced for a no.  She had a flashback to the app, the feeling after being the only girl in her class and one of only three girls in their grade to zero out.  “I- yeah,” she persevered.  “Not a friend thing, but an actual date.  Is that okay?  You can catch me up on everything I missed while I was out of town.”  “I don’t know what you missed-” he said.  Her heart sank a bit.  Negation again, no, was he maneuvering for a refusal?  Was it-  “Canada day?” she tried.  Evading her own doubts.  Pushing forward a bit more.  “Or the party?”  “I mean, not sure what to talk about about that, but-”  “We can talk about whatever,” she talked over him, pushing forward again, despite herself, despite knowing she’d be feeling sucky and kicking herself for a week for every little push she’d extended herself if he said the wrong thing, already feeling sucky and kicking herself for taking things to this point, for sounding too try-hard, when he was going to say-  “But yeah,” Wallace said, flushing a bit, smiling all of a sudden like it was Christmas.  “Yeah.  We can talk about whatever.  Do you have your phone?”  She pulled out her phone.  They exchanged contact info.  She smiled, noticed a bit of hair was sticking out sideways, like stupid, and tucked it behind her ear.  She typed in the info.  “Gonna go talk to a grouchy old lady.  See ya,” she told him.  He nodded, smiling goofy.  She walked off, and at the very last point where he’d be out of sight, glanced back.  She caught a moment where Wallace rejoined his dad at the open front of the car, his dad clapping a hand on Wallace’s back.  And that was a whole lot of warring emotions and ideas in her head.  Gratification because that was clearly an attaboy thing and it was nice to be worth an attaboy, but also she missed that she wouldn’t get some equivalent from her own dad.  Or Paul, a bit.  Why had she brought up the sling?  Why not Jeremy or the end of year party or more movies or something?  She dreaded the next dumb thing she’d say if he did reach out or if he said yes when she reached out.  She was glad that they’d reached that endpoint of sharing numbers.  Her hair had looked dumb with that one bit sticking out without her knowing but the rest of her looked good, right?  She was worth a goofy smile.  Glad and anxious and kicking herself and validated and kicking herself and sad all at the same time.  She was left very unsure of what to feel.  She passed by Verona’s place and the idea of dads bubbled to the surface and she settled for feeling a bit down that she couldn’t share this moment with her own dad.  And her ex-stepdad Paul was there as a half entry who could’ve been a full entry if he’d tried, a guy who just made everything suck more by butting in, inside her head.  Just until I get to the bridge, she told herself.  Past the corner store, to the bridge, over the dinky little river that cut Kennet in half.  Avery, Snowdrop, and Reggie the Composite Kid were already at the far side.  “-there wasn’t even any skull sticking out.  It’s pristine!  Not even gross at all!” Snowdrop exclaimed.  “You could even eat off it.  I couldn’t, but you could!”  “We made a detour,” Avery said.  “So did I.  Hi Reggie,” Lucy said.  “Hi Lucy.”  “What are you up to these days?”  “Running errands.  Getting lessons from Lis on spying on people.  Keeping an eye out for those follow-up witch hunters we’re overdue.”  Lucy nodded.  Her earring picked up a creaking sound.  She turned her head.  Pavement cracked and parted, and paint striped a road it hadn’t earlier.  She looked back, saw the road that had widened, and watched as a car passed.  Verona stood where the car had briefly obscured the view.  She looked around, got her bearings, and jogged toward them.  Slowly, pavement creaked and cracked as the road returned to a normal width.  “Are you using city magic to navigate?”  “Ken said it was okay!”  “So lazy,” Lucy said.  “Efficient,” Verona retorted.  “Rook is very by the book, so if there’s nothing delaying us, we should go,” Reggie said.  “Hey Reg,” Verona said.  “No complaints here.”  “You were with Jeremy?” Avery asked.  “She doesn’t smell like that cat, so probably not,” Snowdrop said.  “I was.  Was nice.  Drew.  Stuff.”  That stuff got a look from Lucy.  Verona smiled at her, cocky.  “Recharging my Self,” Verona said.  “I’m envious.  Not of stuff, but of… anything,” Avery said.  “Blah.”  “Would it bother you if I talked about anything like that, or do you want to-”  “Please!” Avery said.  “Don’t make me hold you back.  I’m getting vicarious enjoyment from you guys and Verona’s the wrong brand.  Please tell me you’re more normal.”  “Normal’s overrated,” Verona said.  “I asked Wallace out on a date.  He said yes!”  “Yes!” Avery said, she had to duck around a light-pole while walking and hurried back to Lucy’s side to engage with her, jiggling her arm. “That’s normal!”  “It is!  It was super awkward!”  “That’s great!”  “Cool,” Verona said, giving Lucy a push on the other arm.  “Wallace is cool in my books.  Nice to his mom.”  “Yeah,” Lucy said, “you’ve said.  Counts for something.”  “What are you doing, what’s the plan?  What are you wearing?” Avery asked.  “Ice cream, I don’t know, I don’t know, does it matter?” Lucy asked, matching Avery’s energy.  “It’s ice cream, we’ll talk awkwardly.  I’m putting my toe in the water.”  “That’s great!” Avery said, again.  “It’s normal!  Is Wallace like your Urge boyfriend?”  “My what?” Lucy asked.  Reggie gave all three of them a weirded out look.  “The pink wheel-”  “Impulse,” Verona supplied.  “Yeah!”  “Not really?” Lucy replied.  Wallace didn’t have long hair or sunglasses and he wasn’t ripped and really if she thought about it the fact they were guys was the only point of similarity.  Defensively, she added, “Verona’s wasn’t much like Jeremy either.”  “He’s a bit like my Impulse boyfriend,” Verona muttered.  “Ugggh,” Avery groaned.  “I didn’t want to talk about it if it’d make you unhappy or lonely or anything,” Lucy said.  “I’m just a bit frustrated, and talking about it doesn’t change that or bring it up it’s just a thing,” Avery said.  “Would you do anything online or long distance?” Verona asked.  “Jeremy suggested that.”  “I dunno.  I guess if I have to.  Maybe we’ll see what the next semester brings and if there’s nobody new in town I’ll explore that.  Feels off though.”  “Not looking forward to the new semester,” Verona said.  “Moving back in with le father.”  “That’s not even French,” Reggie said.  “You really seem like the type who should have a flirtation with French and France and wear a beret at some point in high school, fetishize going to Paris,” Lucy said.  “You should brush up.”  Verona made a gagging sound.  “Nah.  Besides, Canadian French compares to France French like goblins compare to Fae.”  “So you are a little elitist and judgmental on that front, huh?” Avery asked.  “Already partway there.”  Reggie was giving them looks, bewildered or unable to keep up, but Avery was engaged and looked happy and was teasing Verona, which was a step up.  Until Avery glanced in the direction of home.  Was it imagination?  The poisoning of the well from Guilherme’s training, getting her to overthink?  Or was it a tiny step down in Avery’s mood, from a glance.  Staying home with her Grumble, her dad, Declan, Kerry.  Sheridan and her mom, her advocates, leaving.  Lucy wished she knew what to do, because that was an entirely different thing from rescuing Verona from her dad.  There were resources for that.  For Avery it was something very different.  “Not totally looking forward to the new semester either,” Lucy said.  “But that’s a few weeks off.  We have plenty to do before then.”  “Summer, sun, possible beach, the new Carmine will take the throne,” Verona said.  “Distractions, I just hope we’re all in the same class, and I hope it’s doable, home lives and stuff, after,” Avery said.  “I could do with distractions from our distractions.”  “For now, you’ll have to make do with Rook,” the Composite Kid said.  He indicated a fire escape beside a building, not ladders that had to be pulled down, but an actual staircase in black and rust, running alongside the building, with landings for the doors on the second and third floors, and a final stretch going up to the roof.  Box plants lined the roof, and many of the plants were tall, including trellises with English ivy, cultivated tree growths, and towering floral plants.  Birdcages in various styles, all black, all at different heights, all but one empty with doors open, were dangling from hooks on rods.  One of the birdcages had Bridge in it, the door closed.  Lucy glanced at it, then felt like she wasn’t supposed to comment, and looked away.  A table with five sides in the same material and style as many of the birdcages was perched in the center, black metal slats woven like a basket to a flat surface, with five uncomfortable looking chairs in the same style.  “I am not always here,” Rook said, as she emerged from behind one group of reedy plants with white flowers at the base.  Her tone was imperious, no-nonsense.  She carried the mask in one hand and carried a teapot in the other. “Don’t look for me here.  I pack up and go where it suits me.  This location was convenient for today.”  “Thank you for meeting us,” Lucy said.  “You made it your request.  I was told it would be more trouble to refuse than to accept.  I did say I didn’t want to associate with you.”  “You did,” Avery said.  “We got that message.”  “Sit.  You’ll have tea, I insist.  You’ll have bread.  Reggie, would you?  To your left, by the Delphinium, under the lid.  That’s a warding plant.”  Lucy sat across from where Rook stood.  The teapot was set down, and four ceramic glasses without handles followed soon after.  Rook set the fifth down as she sat.  Reggie brought a platter of breads.  There was a butter knife and pre-sliced cheeses.  “Thank you,” Lucy said.  She leaned back as tea was poured.  Tea on a hot day?  “Don’t thank me.  Breaking bread is a time honored tradition.  You must know the rules before you break them or break your enemies’ backs over them.”  “I like that,” Lucy said.  “Yes, practitioners have a long and storied history of breaking the rules,” Rook said, walking around the table to Reggie.  She set a hand on Reggie’s shoulder and looked down at Snowdrop.  “We have had to adapt.  Reggie, dear, take some bread.  This one has chocolate.  There are some bottled drinks on the shelf over there.  Refresh yourself.  Then go have Lis go look after you.”  “I’m not staying, huh?”  “There are only five chairs.  No.  Unless our guests have second thoughts?  No?”  “Good luck,” Reggie said, stooping by one of the box plants, moving a section, and getting an old fashioned glass bottle that had clearly been hand blown, distorting in the process of being blown.  The fluid was orange and a rind from something that definitely wasn’t an orange had settled at the bottom.  He stepped out onto the fire escape and headed down.  “We have privacy, we can talk without pretending,” Rook said, as she continued to pour.  We were supposed to be pretending?  Lucy wondered.  She wasn’t announcing anything, and it was easier to keep a secret by sticking closer to the truth, but was the idea that she was supposed to be pissy with Rook?  That felt more fake than anything.  Rook gestured in the direction of the little cabinet where Reggie had picked up the drink.  “If you’d like cold refreshments, they’re there, but I’d enjoy sharing the tea.  Help yourself to the bread, but please-”  She emphasized that last word.  Snowdrop was already reaching over.  “-wait until I’m seated.”  “Is the tea drugged?” Verona asked, peering into her cup.  “Verona, hey,” Avery whispered, nudging.  “It is a drug, but of negligible effect.  Green tea has been said to help with many ailments of the fifth tier of the midsection; pancreas, digestion, and liver.  The stomach is linked to the mind.”  “Huh,” Verona said, continuing to peer into the cup.  “It’s tea without any malevolent or mischievous intent behind it,” Rook said, smoothing her skirt under her as she sat, the panels rustling.  “Drink, but don’t burn your tongue.”  Snowdrop’s hand hovered over bread.  Rook nodded, and Snowdrop took some.  “Borderline feral,” Avery whispered to her familiar.  Snowdrop put the end of the bread in Avery’s mouth.  Avery bit, and then Snowdrop partook.  “Can we talk about… things?” Lucy asked.  “Yes.  The conspiracy, Edith, Miss, the spirits?” Rook asked.  “Yes we can.  Even the subtler Others of Kennet would announce themselves by entering.  I’m at your disposal.  What do you need?”  “Guidance,” Lucy said.  “We’re running out of time.”  “Most of us are, whether we know it or not.  Tell me, how do you think things went, where do you stand, and where are you going?”  “That’s heavy,” Verona said.  “A whole lot for one answer.”  “Break it into pieces.”  “Can I ask… are you a part of the conspiracy?” Verona asked.  “To get stuff out of the way.”  “Not past nor present, nor, I feel, future.  My motives are ulterior.”  “Ulterior as in…” Verona pressed.  “An eye to the future, secondary to what’s going on in the immediate present.  I don’t want Kennet to suffer the fate that so many places like it have.  Miss took a large part in shaping Kennet to be what it is today, and I’d see her succeed, but the venal and short-sighted would make it something else.  I’ve seen that happen too many times.  It gets slapped down, or it becomes indistinguishable from those things that slap bright, overly noble, and eager ventures down.”  Rook looked at Lucy.  Lucy remembered the conversation with Toadswallow.  Venal meant greedy, right?  That sort of fit.  Ugh.  “You’re not in disguise?  I don’t want to dish information only for you to pull off a mask…”  “I’m not in disguise, but the guise of being Oni is something all of us wear.  I’m one of three Oni in this region from my sect.”  “The three practitioners from the Blue Heron, they let an Oni out of a box,” Avery said.  “One of the other three.  We talk sometimes, collaborate rarely.  We’re more effective independently than together.”  “No tricks, traps, listening devices, no sketchy motives, no rugs to pull out from under us?” Verona asked.  “No, though my ears serve as listening devices, I don’t intend to record what they catch and pass it on to anyone but possibly Miss, who is on your side.  I have traps on my person and in storage around here, but none intended for you, they’re only a tool I keep available.  There are no rugs, metaphorical or otherwise.”  “Sorry, to go this far,” Avery told Rook.  “I’ve been in times and places where asking those questions might have helped win a war that was instead lost.  It’s fine.  In the interest of balance may I ask the same questions of you?”  “We’re who we appear to be,” Lucy said.  “I have my earring, we have phones, but nothing here is being recorded for bad purposes.  I don’t remember the other questions.”  “No tricks or traps meant for you,” Verona said.  “No sketchy motives except, I think, Snowdrop is going to be a glutton.”  “Lies,” Snowdrop said.  “Baldfaced lies.”  “And no rugs,” Verona said.  “And we aren’t a witting part of the conspiracy.”  “I assumed.  How do you think things went?” Rook asked, not taking her eyes off of Lucy.  She moved the mask away from her mouth, and Lucy got a glimpse of those fangs of hers, that curved too far back into Rook’s mouth, until it looked like her narrow tongue would have to dance between them as she spoke.  “It could have gone better,” Lucy said.  “The spirits and echoes and everything.”  “Intentional on their part.  I wasn’t here, but I’ve gleaned the story.  When Miss left to face the Wolf, Edith and Matthew invited the lesser spirits over.”  “We saw some of that,” Avery said, indicating Snowdrop.  “Beginning of our surveillance.”  “Yes.  Edith directed the spirits lesser than her but greater than the ambient ones you draw on for runes and your Word, having them keep a perimeter.  The surface intent was fine and sensible, clouding vision, keeping practice that wasn’t from you three from easily passing from outside to inside, adding power where power was needed, and serving as crude alarms.  But in the doing she made a vacuum, she stacked spirits and other immaterial things outside… and nature abhors a vacuum.  When she was bound, her word was forfeit, the deals ceased, and they no longer avoided the territory the simple deals bound them from.  They came in, overeager and roiled up, many frustrated.”  “And the echoes?”  “A similar principle, but a little more active and ongoing.  Echoes were either burned if they didn’t seem useful, or they were cast out.  The sheer number of Wraith Kings and major Wraiths is derived from a specific climate fostered outside of Kennet.  Echoes mingle with spirits to become Wraiths, Wraiths naturally shred and consume other echoes and spirits, becoming Wraith Kings.  An overstuffed aquarium with carnivorous fish in it.  The fish grow fat.”  “I feel like we did everything right,” Lucy said.  “Or mostly everything.  We got permission, we stuck to the law, we answered a Wrong.”  “And if every practitioner acted as you did the other night, then the world would be a brighter place.  But they don’t.”  “I know you’ve told others that you don’t like practitioners,” Lucy said, wary.  “I don’t.  As an institution, I loathe practitioners and what they do.  I’ve been led to believe that you are not the biggest fans of the kind of practice that unfolds under Belanger, or Bristow, or Musser.”  “No,” Lucy said.  “Then we are on very similar pages, I think,” Rook said.  “The onus is on you to hold to your best version of Right.  Miss picked you carefully.  I hope you prove the value in that care.”  “It’s all gone wrong, things are a mess since we bound Edith,” Verona said.  “Be ready for the same to occur, whoever else you bind.  Where are you now?  Where do you stand?”  “Two weeks and two days away from John taking the throne and dying,” Lucy said.  “They don’t have the furs and they don’t seem bothered by it.  We’ve got Witch Hunters who are apparently still out there-”  “Miss cannot hold them off forever.”  “Shrines that need building,” Verona cut in.  “I hope we get a stamp of approval on those.”  “The shrines are fine.  I visited.  The spirits seemed content.  It may be that you’re planting seeds in the hope of enjoying the shade they one day provide, but it’s certainly not a bad idea.”  “We kinda need that spirit shade now,” Avery said.  “We’re weaker.”  “Kennet is shaken.  You draw power from the Kennet Others.”  “We’re adrift,” Lucy said.  “And I’m… peeved.  We had one of the guys who makes the big calls on Karma behind us, and this doesn’t feel like the good karma resolution.  How are we supposed to make a next move?”  “Do you have one?”  Lucy nodded.  “We have strong suspicions on the other culprits, but Edith fell in our laps, it was pretty obvious she’d been running around and playing fast and loose with the oaths.  It looks like Charles might’ve been involved, but because he’s beholden to the Kennet Others, it’s also possible that he’s having his arm twisted.”  Avery spoke up, “We suspected Matthew because he was around when certain lies were told, like when Charles misled us about Yalda, Matthew didn’t correct or clarify.  But he might’ve had his senses fogged by Edith.  Charles could be the same.”  “Feels middle of the road,” Verona said.  “Charles is easy,” Rook said.  “You’re dodging around the more difficult-”  “Maricica,” Lucy said.  “Too many of the quote-unquote gifts she gave us are nasty, the syringe Edith had looked like it came from the Dark Fae… and an awful lot of other, contextual things.  If she isn’t a co-conspirator-”  “I feel certain she is,” Rook said.  “-she’s… okay.  But even if she wasn’t, she’s messing with us enough to almost count.  You do?”  “Yes.  But it’s feeling.  I don’t have any clear proof I can hand you.”  “She’s been hanging back a lot,” Verona said.  “She was hurt by the Aware who came to town.  It’s an excuse to wait and watch.  She had a hand in how things unfolded.  Guilherme told me that Maricica told you she interfered with the beast.”  “Temporarily blinded it,” Verona said.  “Yes.  She set this into motion and she’s watching it unfold.  If you get close, she’ll act.  Perhaps rashly.  If you don’t, I feel she’ll be content to wait until it resolves, then take a hand in the conclusion.”  “You sound certain,” Lucy noted.  “I’m not.  It’s feeling, and my understanding of her and those like her.  There’s more going on, but it’s subtle, and it may only reveal itself in the climax of her plan, or in the aftermath.”  “Can we stop her?” Lucy asked.  “Not if you intend to do it like you did with Edith,” Crooked Rook answered, sipping her tea.  “She’s young for a Fae, but if you dragged her into a basement and put questions to her, aiming to force her to break her word, she wouldn’t break when the person closest to her lost faith in her.  She would use words to tie you in knots and you would most likely find yourself on the wrong end of the Sable Prince’s judgement at the end.  Which leads me again to my question.  What next?”  Talking to Rook was weird, because it felt like talking to Guilherme or even Maricica, though Lucy had talked to Guilherme way more, but when Lucy expected the dodge or the evasive wording, Rook talked plain.  She really appreciated that.  “Bluntmunch wants us to be more careful,” Avery said.  “Set things up so the table doesn’t flop over if too many legs are removed.”  “Sensible, but you only have so much time.  Do you have the time to prepare?”  “We know exactly what that would look like,” Snowdrop said, decisive, “and probably, yes.”  “I was talking about that with Snowdrop earlier,” Avery said.  “What if we don’t?” Lucy asked.  “No time to prepare things or set something else in place?”  “Or if the act of setting something in place would tip off something as wary as Maricica is?” Rook asked.  “Then you deal with the aftermath.”  “You said you’ve seen this play out.”  “I have.  Sometimes in small groups of Others, sometimes closely knit Other and practitioner, sometimes Aware and Other.  Sometimes they’ve tried to prepare, sometimes they’ve done without preparation and the consequences crushed them.  For what it’s worth, my focus and attention is on the consequences.  I’m assuming you’ll fail, and I’ll try to ensure that Miss and I still have influence in the wake of that failure.”  “And us?” Avery asked.  “They’ll be rid of you one way or another.”  Lucy leaned back, holding the tea.  She hadn’t really had much, because it had been hot, and she took a careful drink, digesting all of that.  Now that it didn’t taste like scalded tongue, it was really quite good.  Calming, when she didn’t feel calm.  “You don’t care that my cool friends would bite it?” Snowdrop asked.  “I care, I’ll certainly help,” Rook said.  “Anything you can do now makes it easier for us later.  You’re exceptionally capable for where you’re at in your development, Miss picked you well, you’ve worked hard, but I harbor no illusions.  You’ve been doing this for a few months.  They’ve been working at this for a decade, perhaps longer.  They have decades or even a century of practical experience behind them, between Edith, Maricica, a possible but unlikely Matthew and then Charles.  One possible Other, and any others they’ve recruited in the meantime.  You had the element of surprise and spent it.  Now they know you’re good.  They gave you Edith, knowing this business with the spirits and wraiths would happen, now they’re watching and planning.”  Lucy sipped.  “Are you prepared to lose?” Rook asked.  “Are you prepared for us to win?” Avery challenged her.  “We wrote letters,” Lucy said.  “As just-in-cases.  I’m letting my mom know what’s really been going on, if it all goes wrong.”  “That is not an unusual way to do things.  Miss has remarked on your mother, positively.”  “I told my mom to call in the Witch Hunters, evacuate the good ones,” Lucy said.  “You’re on the list for right now.  So is Reggie.”  “Perhaps calling them in is for the best,” Rook said.  “Compared to the tyranny that may result.  I’ve abandoned situations and I’ve regretted having to walk away to leave the worst people in positions of power.”  “That’s kind of my feeling,” Lucy said.  “We’re really considering this?” Avery asked.  “That the bad guys sometimes win?” Lucy asked.  “Don’t we have to?”  “Not if we succeed.  We can succeed, right?” Avery asked.  “Yes.  But as Edith demonstrated, that comes with its own costs.”  “So let’s talk possibilities, let’s sort it out,” Verona said, leaning forward.  “Also, this is really good tea.”  “It is,” Rook said.  “Maricica,” Verona said.  “Problems.  We can’t go the Sable route.”  “I would reconsider… a large part of my perspective on reality, if you went that route and came out successful,” Rook said.  “She’s way more experienced,” Verona said.  “Lots more years, lots of practical experience, she’s laying in wait, watching for the mistakes we make, maybe messing with us…”  “She may not feel she has to,” Rook said.  “If she can wait and let things fall into place.”  “They aren’t scared about losing Edith or losing… key components of their plan,” Lucy said.  “The corpse of the Carmine?” Rook asked.  Lucy nodded once.  “Don’t tell me anything more.  But, in the abstract, that is something I wanted to address.  You’re underestimating them.”  “Underestimating?” Lucy asked.  “You’ve learned the underlying purpose in bringing Montague into Kennet.  He keeps Miss out.”  “Yeah,” Avery said.  “Which sucks because Miss would help a lot.  If she was in charge again-”  “It would be complicated, but perhaps better.  Toadswallow is fine.”  “Would it have been better if you won?” Lucy asked.  “I didn’t think so.  I voted for Toadswallow.  Being a leader right now would mean being tied up in the same headaches that are snarling you up, with the spirits and echoes.  As it stands, I’m free to act.  No, Montague was one thing.  But every single Other that was invited into Kennet, I believe, with the exception of Tashlit and Peckersnot, and perhaps Peckersnot’s group by extension, were all invited in with a subtle purpose.”  “Subtle as in Maricica subtle?” Lucy asked.  “These are the traps, and the source of her confidence,” Rook said.  “You have limited time to unravel those traps and undermine that confidence.”  “Or two weeks to stop Maricica,” Verona said.  “Or that.  And you’ll want to stop their co-conspirators.  I’ve told you about Lis and Cig.  They’re helping hands and spies on the conspirator side.  Anything you don’t resolve is likely to be their masterstroke in their finale.  You can deal with those masterstrokes now, or you can deal with them then.  I will help where I can, and I will inform where I can, without making it clear that I’m on your side or assisting Miss.”  “That’s a lot,” Avery said, quiet.  “Totally doable,” Snowdrop echoed.  “It is.  Sorry, Verona.  You were talking about Maricica.  I suppose you may add this to the conundrum.”  “She’s more experienced, she’s too crafty to hold at trial with the Sable, and she’s holding the strings, I guess, of all these new Kennet Others?”  “Witting or unwitting,” Rook said.  “Each a double edged sword.”  “What if we had, like, five hundred or a thousand years of experience?” Verona asked, eyes flicking between everyone at the table.  “And we did the opposite of a trial with the Sable?”  “You’re saying that like you’re about to jump off the bridge at the Blue Heron,” Lucy noted.  “And you’re nervous.”  “Do we know when and where Maricica is patrolling?” Verona asked.  “She’s helping, right?”  “I know,” Rook said.  “I can pass on specifics when necessary.”  “Who’s that old and that… not-Sable?” Lucy asked.  “Not one who.  Lots of whos.  Do you think Liberty would be down for a visit?  With a sanctioned goblin raid to ruin the day of a Faerie, and try to bring her into custody?” Verona asked.  She looked at Lucy.  “You said you’d rather burn it down and bring witch hunters in than let them win.  What’s better as a counter to well-laid plans than a whole freaking lot of goblins?  We’d even take a bunch of the locals out of play because they love the Tedds.”  “Heck no,” Snowdrop said.  “That sounds terrible!”  “Oh boy,” Avery said, echoing Snowdrop, but in a worried tone rather than an excited one.

      "               <Document: {'content': '    Lucy entered the classroom and crossed it, until she stood by Harri.  Grandfather was sitting on the unoccupied desk behind the girl, holding her wrists near her elbows, behind her back.  Students throughout the class grinned, shuddered, and giggled without sound.  “So you have different specialties, huh?  One for each of you?” Lucy asked.  The kid lifted her head to give Lucy her best ‘get real’ look.  At her elbow, Lucy could see her hand gripping skin.  Verona came in, having just talked to Angel and Horseman, and immediately went for Harri’s bag, sorting through the contents, putting them on the desk.  “You won’t find any clues in there,” Harri said.  “Yeah?  That saves me a lot of trouble, thanks.”  Verona put the things back and checked the outside of the bag before putting it down.  “Should I search your pockets, socks, shoes, or will you save me the trouble there too?”  “I don’t bring anything for the school day.”  “Did you bring anything for the school night or any other time, that you happen to have now?”  Harri rolled her eyes.  “No.”  “No need to roll your eyes at us.  You guys did bring stuff for the school night, right?  Dead body?” Lucy asked.  Harry looked like she wanted to slump in her seat, but Grandfather had her arms.  “So what’s going on?” Lucy asked.  “You guys sicced a video game monster on downtown?  You’re keeping secrets, you’re being weirdly disciplined, secretive… Was that part of the deal?  From your mentor or mentors?  Do you each have one, or is there only one who gave each of you a book or something?”  “Or are we off base?” Verona asked.  “Was that thing downtown for reasons other than an attack?”  “It sure seemed like an attack, Ronnie,” Lucy said.  “Sure, but I’m just asking, giving opportunities.  Harri, did you guys find a book and stick with it?  Didn’t sound like it from what your buddy said, but if you want to clear the record?”  “No.  Nothing much to say,” Harri told them.  “Because you won’t?” Verona asked.  “Or because you can’t?”  Harri looked up at Verona, then at Lucy.  “My arms are sore.  If I agree to put my hands on the desk, can I?”  “Say it?” Lucy asked.  “I’ll put my hands on the desk and I won’t try anything as long as I’m here doing that.”  Lucy gave Grandfather a nod.  He let go of Harri’s hands, and she rubbed her shoulders.  “Right away, please,” Lucy said.  Harri rolled her eyes, then put her hands on the desk.  “Did you make a deal that you wouldn’t tell anyone what you’re doing?  Won’t share your mentor or mentors, or plans?”  Harri looked at Verona, then Lucy.  “Did you make a deal that you wouldn’t even talk about the terms of that deal?  So you can’t even say?” Lucy asked.  Harri looked up at her, then looked away.  “How do you want to do this?” Verona asked.  She had a deck of cards and was shuffling through them.  “Are you asking me or her?” Lucy asked.  “I mean, if Harri here wants to give some input, I’m open to it, but I don’t think she will.”  Harri remained silent.  Lucy looked over at the deck.  Verona had consulted her when figuring out the suits.  “Any readings?”  “I’m not much of an augur.  Yet.  No real readings.  Wrong type of situation, compared to what I had in mind when the cards were made.”  Lucy nodded.  “So what do you want to do?” Verona asked.  “We can’t leave people Jabbered like this.  So why don’t we head out?  Take Harri, go to the others, and see what can be worked out?”  “Take Harri?” Harri asked.  “You sure?  We could keep searching.  We might not get another chance like this.”  “I don’t like straining Innocence.  Bird in the hand, right?”  “The cat in me wants all the birds.”  “What we want is answers.  And solutions.  They know what’s up, and we can get more answers this way.”  “Yeah?” Verona asked.  “Maybe, okay.”  Lucy looked past Harri to Grandfather.  “What do you think?”  “You’re on point.”  “Horseman?”  “We’re just the muscle.”  “You’re more than that,” Lucy said.  He shrugged.  “To Harri’s buddy, and anyone else listening?” Lucy asked.  “Come talk to us.  Or talk to your mentors and have them talk to us.  ”  “I’m grabbing her?” Grandfather asked.  Lucy nodded.  “I’ll call Matthew,” Verona said, getting her phone out.  “He has a ride.”  “Better than calling my mom, probably,” Lucy noted, wry.  A bit of dry humor to help herself feel better about what they were doing.  Harri screamed in much the same way someone who’d just been burned might scream, as Grandfather hoisted her and lifted her over one shoulder, arms wrapped around her body, pinning her arms to her sides.  They left the classroom, Lucy carrying Harri’s bag and coat.  She did a little hop to throw it over Harri so she wouldn’t be cold, going outdoors.  Horseman followed, bringing the case with Jabber inside, gas leaking out.  The screaming was loud and sustained enough to bring people from further down the school over.  But as they came into range of Jabber, they stopped.  It meant Angel had to move some people aside to make it easier to drag the case with.  Lucy listened carefully for any tells.  Even footsteps would matter.  “Ronnie,” Lucy murmured.  “Got any glamour?”  “Glamour?  I’ve got Winter.”  “I know we’re meant to be careful, but I see a chance here.  Any non-Winter?”  “Uhhh… maybe.  This counts?”  Lucy nodded.  “Shit.  Emergency animal transform,” Verona murmured.  She reached into a back pocket, pulling out some cards and a little envelope, bundled together with an elastic.  She pulled the envelope free, passing it over.  There was some dark fall glamour and a crow feather inside.  Not much.  Lucy passed the feather back to Verona, stroking it to get what glamour she could off it first, then passed over the bag.  Harri kept screaming that no-holds-barred, ragged, high-pitched scream reserved for people young enough their voices hadn’t changed.  She kicked and struggled, wriggling, but Grandfather was older, stronger, and muscular.  “Pipes might have a competitor when it comes to being loud,” Horseman said.  Harri squirmed, turning, twisting and doing a sit-up motion to get as good a view as she could of the people behind them.  “Who are you looking for?” Lucy asked.  Harri dropped, flopping down.  “Guys!” Harri shouted.  “They’re going to-”  Grandfather swung her down, in what must’ve felt like being thrown against the ground, but he caught her, holding her against his front, hand over her mouth.  There was fear in her eyes.  It felt bad, but… what else were they meant to do?  Lucy couldn’t think of a good thing to say that wouldn’t sound sinister with the necessary qualifiers.  We’re not going to hurt you if we can help it?  Okay.  Dark Fall glamour.  She looked, saw how the light shone through the windows, diffuse, and adjusted her stance, weaving the glamour, matching the vague lines painted on the wall, where light shone in through classroom windows, past bars that sectioned off each window, through the doors, and out into the hallways.  She used the stuff Guilherme had taught her to help it happen.  She knew she wasn’t doing it perfectly, but she was painting with glamour to match the flow of the shadows, and she let her body match that flow as well.  Until she was a shadow on the wall, with nobody to cast it.  Her eyes remained almond-shaped slices of sunlight against the wall, in the midst of the shadow.  She chose a spot close to the classroom, where only the most savvy person looking specifically for weird shadows might see her, lingering behind.  It was important in a lot of practices, from glamour like this to binding to have an outlet, a way for excess and pressure to leak out.  Glamour with a tell, even an obscure one, was far sturdier than glamour without.  A ‘perfect’ binding that allowed absolutely nothing out, similarly, could be surprisingly fragile as a result.  And if they could actually detect her or knew to look for her like this, it would say a lot.  Like, she was pretty sure she, Verona, and Avery wouldn’t notice a shadow like this.  Even after a scary moment.  Provided she was careful to hide her eyes.  The others left out the front of the school, taking Harri with.  Lucy waited patiently, watching as the people who’d been Jabbered came to, stirring.  “Get to class,” a teacher in the hallway said.  She’d come to respond to the screaming, as had others, but now that they were all simultaneously stirring awake, she was asserting authority.  “We heard screaming.”  “I know.  Get to class.  The faculty will handle it.”  People dispersed, talking in low voices.  “What do you think happened?”  “My face hurts.  Can you sprain your jaw?”  “How would you sprain your jaw?  Actually, don’t answer that question.”  “Eating?  How else?”  “Don’t ask that question either.”  In the classroom, others were talking.  “I’m drooling.  What’s wrong with me?”  “I think I dozed off too.  School shouldn’t start before noon.”  “I think Mr. Gilbert dozed off too.  Perfect room temperature for a nap.”  “Hey dude, you okay?”  “What?  I’m fine.”  “You look freaked.”  Lucy walked over, keeping to the wall, looking.  She didn’t see who’d spoken.  The teacher who’d been in the hallway went to the first classroom door.  “Everything alright?”  “A slow morning, but nothing much, why?”  “Multiple reports of screaming.  I heard it myself.”  “Rowdiness?  I don’t think I noticed.”  “Are you sure?”  He said something indistinct- not inaudible, but something mumbly that didn’t really qualify as a word, finishing with a cough of a sound that might have been a confused ‘pshh’.  She didn’t have an angle to see, and she wanted to limit how much she moved, so she wouldn’t be too obvious where she was.  The teacher went to two more classrooms, asking similar questions.  Students murmured among themselves.  “Which paragraph did Michael read?  I’m trying to count ahead to my turn.”  “There.  He stopped partway, I don’t think the teacher noticed.”  “Do you want to go skating after?  There’s the rink behind the Arena.”  “What happened?”  “Harri.  She screwed up, I think.”  “Who’s in Harri’s class right now?”  “Shh.  Stefan.”  “So they did something to Harri, we don’t know what’s up with Stefan, Joshua ran…?”  “Shh.  After.  Come to the boy’s bathroom in a few min.”  Lucy glanced around.  Surreptitiously, she moved down the hallway until she spotted the boy’s bathroom.  “You look really nice today, Mrs. Caillier.”  “Thank you, but you’re not in my class, Teddy.”  Lucy watched this Teddy smile, and pull back.  The bathroom pass was in his hand, which was at the doorframe, dangling.  Lucy slipped inside the bathroom so she could be the first one inside.  She saw that sunlight came in at an angle, through snow-laden trees just outside, and moved into the midst of that dappled light, body-line and head masked by the trunk and branch, head turned with curly hair masked by twigs and foliage.  It took only a bit for the first to arrive.  Teddy came in, a year or so older than her, with long arms, long legs, long neck, but not tall, just proportioned like that.  The long neck in particular stood out with the collar of his uniform, which he’d buttoned right up to the top.  Brown hair a uniform, even length, top, back, sides.  His face was very normal, too, brown eyed, with little that was remarkable about it, except for a smirk, and he could stand to get out in the sun more.  He used the urinal, leaning into it, and Lucy turned her attention away.  She saw the door open, as a girl came in.  “Oh gross,” the girl said, shielding her eyes.  “There’s something wrong with you.”  “What did you expect in the boy’s bathroom, Nomi?”  “Shut up.  You signaled, right?”  “Yeah.  Give it a few.”  Nomi shook her head, shielding her eyes from seeing him.  “If I get caught in here…”  “Well, don’t,” he said.  “Try doing something about it.”  Nomi was shorter than Lucy, with brown hair parted down the middle, and a smattering of freckles.  She wore a choker and a necklace, and had two overlapping bracelets at her wrist, hidden but only barely, in the sleeve of her school uniform.  She used lipstick to draw a connection block on the wall.  “You’re not supposed to have that in school,” Teddy said, as he zipped up.  She snorted with a half-laugh.  The rest came, one by one.  One of the boys from the class, who’d been sitting near Harri.  Stefan.  His hair curled in toward the forehead from both sides, which drew attention to his wide, tall forehead.  Three more boys in a group, with a girl trailing behind.  Lucy caught the names as they got the update on what people theorized had happened with Harri.  Adrian, Travis, and Dony.  The girl was Kira-Lynn.  Joshua, went to the roof, Harri we got.  Now here we have Stefan, Dony, Travis, Adrian, Teddy, and the two other girls, Kira-Lynn and Nomi.  Nine.  “It’s dark in here,” Kira-Lynn said.  She had a limp black ponytail that pointed straight down and free locks of hair framing the sides of her face.  She hit the light switch.  Lucy adjusted, hands turning to lighten the shadow that made up this body.  Her timing wasn’t perfect, but nobody was looking.  “We’re missing two,” Kira-Lynn said.  “What were the screams?”  “Joshua lost his nerve and bolted,” Teddy explained.  “Harri got took.”  “Took?”  “I know as much as you do.”  “Joshua told them stuff,” Stefan said.  The boy who’d been with Harri.  “What stuff?”  “Stuff.  That we have specialties, I guess.”  “Did they take him?”  “The ones who went after him didn’t come back with him.  I think he got away.  Or they let him get away, for information.”  “Oh my God,” Nomi muttered.  “Well, today was a fuck.”  “Stefan?” Kira-Lynn asked.  “How did they get Harri?  She had the charm?”  Stefan nodded.  He hesitated.  “But she made a sound.”  She made a sound because you talked, you weasel, Lucy thought.  “I thought she was better than that,” Kira-Lynn muttered.  Stefan shrugged at the same time he shrank into himself a fraction.  Lucy saw it, and she saw a momentary change in Kira-Lynn’s expression as the girl turned away from Stefan.  “I didn’t want to text, but how many of you noticed weirdness this morning?”  “Weirdness?  Besides laughy chucklefuck, the soldiers, and two scary-ass witches stomping through in the middle of the school day?” Teddy asked.  “Yeah.  Besides that.  I had a white crow on my windowsill this morning.”  There were heads shaking throughout the group.  “Other stuff too.  Weird figures in the snow flurries.  You guys really didn’t see this?”  “A little distracted by other shit,” Teddy said.  “Figures?” Nomi asked.  Kira-Lynn shrugged.  “People.  Moved funny.  Some big, some small.  One on a horse.”  “A horse?  On the street or on the field?”  Nomi paced.  She came very close to Lucy and then seemed to realize she’d walked up to the urinals, and made a face.  She walked away.  “Today’s such a fuck.  God.”  “Stop taking the Lord’s name in vain,” Teddy said, smirk dropping from his face.  Nomi snorted again.  “What?” Teddy asked.  “The time for worrying about that was months ago,” Nomi said.  Months.  Nomi was shaking her head.  “I can’t believe they got Harri.”  “Are you okay, Adrian?” Kira-Lynn asked.  One of the three boys.  Blond, straight hair, glasses.  “I’m fine.”  “She’s your cousin, right?”  “Yeah.”  “You don’t love her, or you don’t care, or…?”  “I love her fine, I guess.  But it doesn’t feel real.”  “I’m pretty sure it’s real, guy,” Nomi said.  “So what do we do?” Stefan asked.  Harri’s classmate, weasel, one of the youngest here.  “For Harri, for later, for tomorrow, plans?  What do we do?”  Teddy said, “I want to bring practice stuff to school.  Just in case we need to defend ourselves.  If the innocence charm failed for more of us-”  “If you bring practice stuff to school the charm won’t work,” one of the three other boys said.  Lucy hadn’t put names to faces, but it was either Travis, or Dony.  “If the charm hadn’t worked, we couldn’t’ve played along like we needed to.”  “What happens if we need to defend ourselves?” Teddy asked.  “Know the right names to call,” Nomi replied, shrugging.  “Prepare in advance.”  “My thing’s not calling names,” Kira-Lynn said.  “Then stick close to me, I guess.  I mean, if they really come at us, the way they’ve been talked about, I’m not sure what we can do.”  “Scatter,” Teddy said.  “Prepare in advance,” Nomi said, again.  “Prepare, prepare, prepare.”  “Traps?” Kira-Lynn asked.  “Maybe.  That’s one direction we could take,” Nomi said.  She looked over at Teddy.  “Right?”  “Yeah.  Sure.  Or, I know not all of you like the idea, but we could ask for help.”  “Who?  Because there’s a lot of people we could ask.”  A lot of people, Lucy noted.  “Teachers,” Teddy said.  “We’re already in trouble, we’re already in the middle of an avalanche of fuckups,” Nomi said.  “Calling them outside the usual meeting times is supposed to be emergencies only.  Fuck, meeting like we’re doing right now is supposed to be way more controlled and organized than this.”  “One of us got kidnapped,” Kira-Lynn said.  “That’s not an emergency?  We shouldn’t be meeting?”  “A big-ass alien Other slipped our binding and went on a rampage, and we didn’t call for help then.”  “One of us got kidnapped.  Adrian, seriously?”  Adrian looked at Kira-Lynn.  “I mean, yeah, I want to help her, for sure.”  “I’m on your side,” Teddy told her.  “Serious situation, let’s call the teachers for help.”  “My teacher looked down my shirt, I don’t want to call him,” Kira-Lynn said.  Teddy protested, “Guys do that automatically!  It’s hardwired!”  “Decent guys don’t,” Kira-Lynn said.  “Decent guys hide it better.  Right?  Stefan?  Adrian?  Travis?  Dony?  Back me up here.  Someone.”  “I looked down my mom’s shirt once, automatically,” Stefan said.  “I wish I hadn’t.  Scarred me.”  “That is really fucked up,” Teddy told him.  “You’re fucked up, kid.”  “I’m backing you up!  Why are you getting on my case when I’m backing you up?”  “That’s your mom.  She’s off limits.”  “Okay, first of all,” Kira-Lynn interjected.  “Why can’t all girls be off-limits like that until you marry them?”  “That’s ridiculous,” Teddy asserted.  “And second-”  “It’s really ridiculous, by the way.”  “-What if we called two or three teachers?” Kira-Lynn asked.  “You want to piss off your teacher?” Nomi replied.  “I really don’t care how pissed off he is.  I’ll be around him for the meet-ups and lessons, but I don’t want to be around him otherwise.  He’s a creep.”  “Careful,” Teddy said.  “Slinging stuff like that around, you could get hit for lying.”  “He’s a creep, he’s a creep, he’s a creep.  Joshua’s is scary, Nomi’s is crazy.  Blame me for it after if you want.  Let’s call three.”  “If we call all the teachers, won’t that help average it out?” Teddy asked.  “How are you going to average out creepiness, abusiveness, and craziness, huh?”  Nomi clapped her hands, hard.  Lucy felt the shadow waver.  She shifted her footing and stance slightly, keeping her eyes mostly closed.  The glamour settled.  “What was that about?” Teddy asked.  “You’re messing up my connection block.”  The lipstick on the wall had chapped.  Nomi shook her head.  “This whole situation is such a fuck.  Don’t fuck it more by fighting.  Now, reasonably, one at a time…”  “If they’re all together, it means both Joshua’s teacher and Kira-Lynn’s teacher have to behave.  I don’t know the deal with yours, Nomi.  She seems cool.”  “She’s sad.  There’s something really wrong with her, but mostly he’ss sad.  I pity him.”  “But can you trust her?  Can we get help from her?” Kira-Lynn asked.  “Yeah.  I think.”  “So why can’t we ask her, say, Teddy’s, Adrian’s…?  Even Harri’s teacher.  If we say she’s in trouble, maybe she’ll want to help Harri?”  “I think it’s way more fucking dangerous to insult them by not calling them, than it is to call them like we’re meant to-” Teddy stressed the last few words, then went on, “-and deal with them being around.”  Lucy turned her attention to the ones in the background.  Adrian was Harri’s cousin, then there was Travis and Dony.  Stefan had talked more, but didn’t seem to be steering the conversation like the oldest three were.  It was like they were just waiting to be told what to do.  “Adrian!” Nomi raised her voice.  It startled Lucy a bit too.  “What?”  “Pay attention,” Teddy told him.  “Sorry.  What?”  “Do you think Harri’s going to talk?”  Adrian shook his head.  “She hasn’t said anything, done anything?”  “We don’t talk.”  “Based on what you know about her, then?”  “I barely know her.  Her mom’s cuckoo and her dad’s… intense.”  “Intense how?”  “Intense like… we had a big camping trip, four years ago-”  “Give us something more relevant, recent,” Teddy said.  “Shut up and let Adrian talk.”  “Coyotes showed up.  We were kids, we didn’t put food away, they were interested.  They weren’t quitting, there was a whole pack, like gangly wolves, I guess.  He was the only one who wasn’t losing his mind.  Grabbed a stick, poked one, when they got provoked, he swatted two or three of them at once.  Barely blinked, didn’t flinch.  And it’s like… she’s like that, kind of.”  “As family holiday stories go, that’s one of the more reassuring ones you could’ve told,” Teddy admitted.  “Yeah, probably.”  “She said during the Awakening ritual, she didn’t want to be her mom, right?” Kira-Lynn asked, unsure.  “She said she hates her.”  “I don’t know what’s up,” Adrian said.  “Except there hasn’t been a single family holiday she showed up to that she didn’t go ballistic.  It’s like a kid throwing a tantrum, but she’s a grown-up.”  “You’re more than halfway to being grown-up,” Teddy said.  Don’t call them grown-ups.”  Adrian looked off to the side-perilously close to Lucy.  “She’s like a toddler, but she knows secrets, swear words like you’ve never heard before, she can reach and throw bottles.  She’s not normal when she’s, like, usual.  Like she’s always a bit drunk.  But something, the stupidest shit, it sets her off.  I hate her too.  Makes our grandma cry.”  “You show more emotion about that than you have about her being kidnapped.”  “It doesn’t feel real,” Adrian said, quiet.  “But she takes after her dad?  She won’t crack?”  “Mostly, except her dad loves her mom.  He’s like the rock, and her mom’s like… napalm.  And Harri’s a rock.  No heat, nothing like her mom.  Hates her mom.”  Lucy badly wanted to ask what else was going on here.  If there was something tying these people together.  She had only suspicions.  “Adrian,” Teddy said.  “Yeah?”  “Can you make a call out?  To the teachers?  In a way that won’t be traced back to us?  With technomancy.”  Adrian nodded.  And there’s our technomancer.  “I still think it’s a mistake to not call all of them,” Teddy said.  “I’ll take the blame,” Kira replied.  “It doesn’t work that way in actuality,” Teddy said.  He turned to Adrian.  “Mine, yours, Kira-Lynn’s and Harri’s teachers.”  Adrian nodded.  He got out his phone.  “You’re not supposed to have that in school,” Teddy told him, wagging a finger.  Adrian ignored him, putting the phone on the flat part of one of the sinks, then drawing on the back.  “Spirits of place, obfuscate, spirits of vox, do outfox, and spirits of tech, shuffle the deck.  Mask my trail and shake any tail.  I’m forgetting a verse.”  “Well, remember,” Teddy told him.  “Try, Adrian,” Nomi said, gentler.  They were such a mess.  The infighting, the casual disrespect, the power imbalance.  The only problem was that they were here, they were equipped with some really effective tools for staying out of sight and going undetected, and they had some powerful practices.  It made Lucy think of the worst she, Verona, and Avery had been, but that was their baseline.  She just had to figure out-  “I can use power to push through.”  “Then do that, then.”  Lucy watched from the literal shadows with eyes narrowed to slits, as he put down a number.  Three digits, arranged vertically, a dash, and then four more digits.  Like a quarter of a frame around the simple diagram in the center.  He formed an L with finger and thumb, framing those numbers, then began to recite numbers.  Lifting his fingers away from the sink and the phone he’d placed on sink’s edge, he levitated the phone up.  With his other hand, chalk still resting between index and middle fingers, he typed on the underside.  “Don’t distract me.  This is hard and precise.”  “What is?” Teddy asked.  Nomi punched Teddy in the arm.  “We’re supposed to teach each other as we learn.”  Adrian explained, “Technomancy simplifies.  Usually at a cost to establishment.  Because tech is new, the patterns and grooves for the practice aren’t worn in.  So you can do stuff fast and easy, but also… it can break easy, or doesn’t last long, or you don’t get much power out.”  He finished punching in whatever he was punching in on the underside of the levitating phone.  The numbers that he’d put down in chalk were changing every second.  Sometimes they looked like wingdings.  “Then you can do a lot of what other practices do, especially with realms.  Or in this case… reaching out to another realm.”  Black wires began to pour out of the downturned screen, onto sink, onto floor.  The mirrors grew bright, reflecting a light that wasn’t there, and then the brightness became television static.  Lucy’s earring picked up the first two rings of very distant phones, that swiftly drew closer.  On the third rings, the others turned their heads.  Lucy moved carefully to avoid being ensnared or being obvious as the shadows changed, and the bathroom was swallowed up.  The bathroom stall doors slammed shut.  Jangling ringing phones could be heard from each.  The kids looked surprisingly at ease with all of this going on.  Lucy moved carefully and gently, retreating as the wires covered the walls.  The only thing that saved her was that she was shadow and the wires were black, but they wormed between her and glamour.  She had to back out.  She couldn’t be shadow anymore.  She ducked low, and moved off the wall, hands tracing the lines of wires and matching the way they flowed out of the wall and spooled out.  She thought of Alpeana, and her fingers went to hair.  She used her own hair, tracing out black spiraling cords, quickly pleating them into braids, as she crouched behind Teddy.  The phones jangled louder and louder, making the work tougher.  “As the diagram suggests, I’d like your help in obscuring a call,” Adrian said.  The jangling of the phones stopped.  Lucy froze.  As a mass of braided black hair and shadowy body, she slipped into the stall.  Three broken bodies framed a pay phone.  Beeps sounded, like those for an old answering machine in the movies.  “Calling my master and mentor,” Adrian said.  Lucy peered through the gap between the stall door and the frame to see Adrian put the phone to his ear.  Black wires crawled down his arm and leg as he did so, pouring out and multiplying like warm molasses.  “They showed up at the school,” Adrian said.  “The Others or the practitioners?”  “The cat and the fox, three soldiers, the alchemical doll.  Came through while everyone was gassed, I guess.  Started seeing who wasn’t affected.  Harri screwed up or something.  They-”  “Don’t use names.”  “My cousin, they took her away.”  “Don’t use identifying details either.”  “And we don’t know what happened to- we think his mentor is going to be pretty mad.”  “I know who you mean.  I’ll talk to him.”  “We were hoping to keep this semi-contained.  Without involving him.  Or, uh, the young mentor.”  “They know already.”  “They know already,” Adrian repeated.  “Damn it to hell,” Teddy whispered.  “I’ll tell them we can handle this.  But you guys need to do your share.”  “What’s our share?”  “The Dropped Call will renew the contract at the end of the month, but you need to set up a ward.  So people can’t pass through as easily.  You should know what you need to do to set that up.  Teach the others while you do it.”  “Set up a ward for the Dropped Call?” Adrian asked, apparently for the benefit of the others listening in.  Kira-Lynn was nodding.  “Second, the White Rot.  Stop in at their second branch, pick up the package, drop it off at what will be their fourth branch.”  “Spreading the White Rot, sure.  Uh, I guess.  We don’t know where the branches are.”  “I’ll send you.  But you’ll have to get from the second branch to the fourth on your own.  Can any of you drive?”  “No.”  “I’ll send a vehicle.  It’ll either be a limo, a cab, or a white van with writing on the side.  Don’t look for or talk to the driver.  Just get in, trust.”  “Don’t look at or talk to the driver, got it.”  “Third, because these things work best in threes.  The Ordinary Family.”  “That’s not Technomancy, is it?  The Ordinary Family.”  “Kira-Lynn will be on point.  She should talk to her mentor.  He’s waiting for the call.  He’ll tell her what needs doing.  Probably something to do with the people who are poking around the Lordship, trying to decipher what’s happening.”  “Kira-Lynn?  Ordinary family, you have to talk to your master.”  “This would be easier if we were on speaker,” Teddy said.  Adrian shook his head.  “Doesn’t work.”  “Hm?  She’s not cooperating?”  “No, someone asked a question.  It’s fine.  I think she’ll do as you ask.”  “Three more things.”  “I thought three was the magic number.”  “Those are responsibilities for forces we’ve contracted for power.  These three things are responsibilities to us.  First, one more.  Have you researched, found someone?”  “Yeah.  We think so.”  “Bring the name and information for me when you come.  I’ll check with everyone involved, make sure they work.”  “Yeah.  And we get one new member.  And hopefully they’re not a replacement for Harri or Joshua.”  “Joshua’s fine, he’s just in a bad place.  We’ll reunite you before you’re done your first errand with the Dropped Call.”  “Joshua’s fine.  We’ll see him soon.  And Harri?”  “She should be fine.  Don’t worry.  Second thing.  Tell me now, can you come immediately?”  “Can we come immediately?”  “I’m pretty sure my connection blocker is fucked,” Nomi said.  “People are probably wondering why we’re taking so long.  If we leave, people are going to wonder where we ran off to.”  “I don’t think we can come immediately.”  “It’s best if you do.  I can handle the calls to your homes, I can make sure there’s no consequences.  You may be late for dinner.”  “He says it’s best if we go, he can handle the school side of it.”  “Then let’s,” Teddy said.  Lucy moved her head to view Teddy through the gap.  He wasn’t smirking.  “Yes, then.  The group agrees.”  “Third?  A message to give to them, I’m told to say this precisely.”  “Okay?  Message seems easy.”  “I quote, push things further, and that will have to be it, move very carefully from now on.”  Adrian didn’t respond right away.  “What?” Stefan asked.  “Tell them.”  “Did we screw up that badly?”  “What did he say?” Teddy asked.  “Uh, repeat that for me?  Maybe I didn’t hear it right.”  “I quote, again, push things further, and that will have to be it.  Move very carefully from now on.”  Adrian repeated it, then repeated his question.  “Did we screw up that badly?”  “I didn’t think so, but I was told it was important.”  “You were told that by who?” Adrian asked.  “No names.  No identifying details.  We’ll discuss when you come.  Inscribe the mark of the bái làn on your phone.”  “On it.”  “What the hell?” Nomi asked.  “I don’t know.  He doesn’t know either,” Adrian said.  “He says we’ll discuss when we come.  We good to go?”  “I guess,” Teddy said.  “A really fucking ominous way to start today’s little series of adventures, isn’t it?”  “Yeah,” Stefan agreed.  A few seconds passed in silence.  Then the walls bulged inward.  Lucy leaned over, pressing against one wall of the stall.  Faces.  Distorted, with eyes cataract white, each eye oozing white pus that streaked down like tears.  They pressed against the wires from the outside, some opened mouths that produced more faces, that split off on their own.  Each was surrounded by flickers of what looked like the kind of squares that appeared on any corrupted image or video file.  Wires snapped and tore, sinks and mirrors broke, and a giant face consumed the bathroom from the one side, baring off-color teeth and a tongue that looked like fungus was growing on it, with more of that image corruption effect around it.  It snapped, consuming the seven kids, biting into wires, and then retreating to a place that Lucy couldn’t see.  Her glamour was in tatters, but as the thing pulled away, it pulled at wires, and it was like it pulled the curtain back.  Leaving reality.  Sinks intact, mirrors unbroken.  No group of St. Victors students.  Only a broken, mangled, and sputtering phone in the sink.  Lucy felt a bit gross, having been on the bathroom wall, and then in proximity to the Dropped Call’s black wires and the White Rot’s faces.  She went to the sink and washed all the skin she could easily get to, eyeing the broken phone in the sink to her right.  Looking past it, she saw the window fogging up, as if adjusting to the recent environmental disturbance, and she saw frost creeping across that fog, the cold reclaiming things.  Frost with patterns, and frost that didn’t fill in certain spots.  At the same time, snow blew in fat flakes, and those flakes traveled curious paths.  Avoiding certain spots.  She took her time to fix her hair, since she’d twirled and braided parts.  Putting things in order.  Getting back to being bulletproof.  Working at doing it with an audience that probably cared more than she did about that ‘bulletproof’ sense of personal aesthetic.  Like she’d been preparing herself for years and this was one of the tests.  And maybe, just maybe, if she got it right…  She picked lint off her shoulder, and washed it away.  Then she finally allowed herself to test her theory.  She unfocused her eyes-  And it brought the two Fae at the window into sharp focus, comparatively.  She walked to the window, reaching for the clasp she needed to undo to open it up, and the Fae departed, picked up by the wind like they were nothing.  Like they’d never been there in the first place.  Lucy had hoped to earn the chance to talk to them.  Exchange words.  It felt lonely, and problematic, and it was only going to feel worse.  She fast-walked out of St. Victor’s, bag over her shoulder, and heard a teacher shout after her, asking what she was doing in the building.  Didn’t matter.  She got her phone out, then picked Verona’s number, tapping it.  She held her phone to her ear with a gloved hand.  “You’re okay?” Verona asked.  “Yeah.  Think so.  Where are you?”  Verona told her.  Kennet below was good.  Lucy took a detour, past the school, past the students who were milling around.  Apparently it was lunch already.  St. Victors had their lunch a little later, which made life easier for anyone trying to quickly rush up to downtown to get a bite and then come back.  Behind a house that bordered the woods to the east of Kennet, south of the valley by the ski hill, she found the thicket of trees.  She climbed the rise of the thicket, up into the densest part, circled around a dead tree, and then stepped down onto another side of the sloping bit of hill.  It was icy and muddy, and she controlled her slide down it, jogging the few steps after she hit the bottom.  Through more dark trees, and into another version of Kennet.  There were similar routes by which a black sheep could find their way down here.  This was one route that had been found and opened up by the invading practitioners at the cabins, back in the fall.  Hands in her pockets, Lucy passed through the upper end of Kennet’s residential east side, past the cabins where it was shockingly cheap to stay but there was a chance of being axe murdered, and glanced at the ski hills, where things had been laid out and cultivated in advance of winter, to have hills with large rocks, steep drops, and one difficult jump that had to be made.  A Fae stood on a rocky outcropping, dressed in flowing white, with folds draping down about twenty feet down the rocks.  They looked annoyed as a denizen of Kennet below zipped past them, coming close to riding over the draping cloth.  They looked annoyed in general, even.  Lucy wondered what they’d say if she asked.  Did they hate Kennet below?  She wasn’t sure, because Guilherme didn’t.  It wasn’t his favorite place, but no place outside his cave seemed to be his favorite place.  But he respected part of the logic of Kennet below, she figured.  That the law was as absolute as it was.  Nostalgic, he’d called it.  Maybe the Fae up on the rocks hated that this place smelled like goblin.  That had probably been what Verona had hinted at.  That if they could get the market going, expand the market, and expand that influence, it would potentially be cover.  A place they could retreat to, that the Wild Hunt would be more reluctant to pursue them into.  Verona met Lucy at the edge of downtown.  “So?” Verona asked.  Lucy widened her eyes.  She met Verona’s, and did all she could to communicate with a glance.  And she was glad, so glad, that Winter’s Wild Hunt weren’t here in any major numbers, because she didn’t feel confident, and she needed to be weak for a moment, and she couldn’t afford to be weak in front of them.  “That bad?”  🟂  “They’re very intentionally us.  Like Avery, Verona, and me.  Magnified in number, in the power they’re tapping into that gives them easy shortcuts, in the mentors they’ve picked up.  They’re elusive, they’re surrounded by layers of tricks, that insulate them.  They’ve marked out a little territory that’s theirs, but they’ve also established connections to the wider region.  They’ve been active for months, and we didn’t even know.”  “And what do they lack?” Guilherme asked.  “Bonds to one another.  But that feels like a cutesy answer.  Like a Saturday morning cartoon, with kids in squeaky voices talking about the power of love.  Where’s the tangibility in that?”  Guilherme’s answer was only a glance- one that conveyed whole verses of text about what he thought of her bringing Saturday morning cartoons into the conversation.  “And they got a warning today.  They didn’t understand, they didn’t think they deserved to be put on notice.  Which was right, because that warning was meant for us.”  “And you know the power that was able to give them that warning and know you’d receive it?”  Lucy nodded.  “But-”  He raised a hand, stopping her.  She nodded.  She’d had to do the glance at Verona, to make sure Verona got it.  She’d had to convey it to Avery in the call she made.  She was about seventy percent sure she knew who had orchestrated this school thing.  Well, sixty percent.  There was a chance the conspirators weren’t perfectly aligned.  But whatever that alignment was, whoever it was, exactly, the warning made one thing clear.  It was something she’d already been worrying about.  The conspirators were drawing their line in the sand.  Every group that had been active over the last few months had been acting on a sort of loose truce.  Musser holding off and postponing his moves on Kennet, Charles holding back and rallying his forces, holding the Lordships, amassing or regenerating power, depending on whatever it was he was doing now.  Kennet was building itself up.  Each group doing their best to expand, grow, and find a position to hold within this chaos.  Whoever had set this up had decided this was a position they wanted or needed to hold.  And if they were interfered with, or if Lucy, Verona, and Avery kept investigating and trying to find the chinks in the armor… they’d act.  And that will have to be it.  She imagined Charles’ voice saying it, and she couldn’t help but give it meaning.  He – or one of the other conspirators, she supposed she could imagine Maricica doing this, or Lis – had drawn their battle line.  And if that line was crossed, they would destroy her or destroy Kennet, to protect what they were doing.  Or she and Kennet would have to destroy them.  Musser was coming soon.  Charles had set up this- this malignance in Kennet.  Like cancer was healthy cells turned ugly and all-consuming, these kids weren’t in a good place, were a broken reflection of Lucy and her friends.  The Others and powers they were using, they felt similar.  Lucy could only think of Father Gobar and the Dropped Call, the White Rot, and imagine cancer spreading.  Bracken stretched until his shoulder and arm popped in different places, stirring Lucy’s attention.  She’d been in the middle of talking to Guilherme, and she’d gotten lost in thought.  But she was here, in the cave, for a training session.  Bracken and Melissa were here, listening and getting caught up.  Both knew enough to not stick their nose in something this bad, right?  “Don’t get involved, don’t do anything on your own,” she told them.  “Nah,” Melissa replied, quiet.  “I’m your blackguard.  Point me in the direction you need, if you need me.”  Even Melissa was subdued.  “We’ll start our lesson,” Guilherme declared.  “Lucille?  This is an important one for you.”  Lucy shifted her stance.  She only had a few days of practice, but there were ways she could move and hold herself that made sense now, in line with the environment, the various kinds of situations this could devolve into.  Ways where she could intuit and respond to a knife thrown at her back, or shift slightly to sidestep the worst of the cold if the cold wind blew directly in through the entrance.  “Fight me,” Guilherme told them.  “And do not dare spar with me, for if you hold back in the slightest, you’re likely to be eviscerated, and you’d best hope you can be swiftly delivered to the local God-Begotten for a healing after.”  Fight you, Lucy thought.  Yeah.  His choice of training mission said a lot.  Fighting something impossible.  Something bigger than she was.  She had to do it with Musser.  She had to do it with Charles and his cancerous group now, who were helping support his Lords and doing it from Kennet, under Kennet’s nose.  Sixteen Wild Hunt Fae stood around the edges of the room.  Each was distinct and interesting enough that they threatened to catch her eye, and she couldn’t let them.  Because if she did, Guilherme would make sure to impart a bloody lesson, and it would probably be her last.  Not in the sense that she’d die.  But in the sense that he’d have her barely survive, the wound severe enough she’d get to Tashlit in just enough time.  And then he’d never teach her again.  Whether because she’d failed when it counted, or because the Wild Hunt would do away with him.  Or her.  Or both.  Again, not in the sense that they’d die.  Worse.  “Empty your mind.  Whatever you face in the future, knowing you can hold yourself in a match like today’s will help.  Focus on this match.”  The Wild Hunt were watching.  They were another threat too big to take on in direct confrontation.  But just like Musser and Charles, they were threatening to be forces she had to take on anyway.  She allowed herself that thought, and then she moved, indicating with the movement of her rapier-tip, out of Guilherme’s sight, that Melissa should go one way.  Bracken another.  Guilherme was bigger, faster, had more reach, more skill.  And the three of them together, their reach put together didn’t equal Guilherme’s with his spear.  Their speed put together didn’t equal his.  Their size, their skill, none of it equaled him.  Even if they could somehow combine together.  So she had to find a way.  In the fraction-of-a-split-second moment that it took a veteran warrior like Guilherme to adapt from dealing with one target to dealing with another.  She had to add that delay to their combined speed.  The shift on positioning that he had to make to keep the three of them in view-  She barely even saw him move as the spear came at her.  Her rapier flicked out, and then, as she turned her body to keep Melissa from seeing the particulars, briefly made it a heavy iron club, for the added weight and momentum, to give her what she lacked in strength, to push the spear further aside.  Fractions.  Slivers of slivers of advantage.  She turned, the club becoming a rapier again, scraping the floor in a three-quarter circle as she turned, kicking up glamour.  A flick of the rapier, helped by an adjustment in its form, shortening it halfway through.  To color and shape that glamour as it puffed up and out.  A twist of the rapier at the same time, to create a flash of light, to hide things further from Melissa.  A slice of silver-gray and white, from a turn in the glamour that was one of the first lessons they’d had in shaping it.  “Catch!” she told Melissa.  Melissa, still partially blind, grabbed it out of the air, but it was an awkward grab.  Her ankle wasn’t strong, she’d stepped too far.  “There was a blade under that dust!?”  Lucy would’ve liked to do better, but using a rapier to draw out another blade in glamour on the fly was still pretty good, she felt.  She emptied her mind of the presence of those Fae who watched, judging.  She had to do this.  Guilherme stabbed out, taking advantage of Melissa’s stumble.  Bracken kicked the shaft of the spear as it passed him.  The point cut Melissa’s clothing, and scraped the ground beside Melissa.  According to Guilherme, It was an art form in the courts to take a non-Fae and introduce them to something in a way that made them seem like they were experts.  To hold a conversation with fellow Fae, and not only navigate the dynamics of that conversation with the Fae, but also have a human compatriot present, and make them look distinguished and witty.  To dance with someone who had no idea how to put one foot beside the other, and make them look beautiful.  Bracken wasn’t even trying to do that.  He was a good fighter, but he had rough edges.  Lucy had to not only deal with Guilherme, but account for the rough edges.  Melissa wasn’t even a good fighter.  She turned, adjusting her footing and posture, to account for different flows in the room.  Of Bracken and Melissa both.  And the spear Guilherme wielded.  And Guilherme himself-  She only barely noticed the movement in shadow.  A second spear, thrown, while he maneuvered the first.  She moved, sidestepping it in the moment it plunged home.  It punched into the slate floor, burying itself to the halfway point.  Lucy, dressed in clothes she’d wear in gym class for a thirty degree day in spring, wasn’t able to get out of the way and navigate the flows of cold air into the cave.  She stumbled a bit, and stumbled straight into the cold air.  Skin prickled painfully, like a quiet, unnecessary rebuke, and the air she took into her lungs was cold.  When she exhaled, it fogged, where it hadn’t before.  Snowflakes chased their way in around her.  She fixed her posture.  They were watching.  She was being tested.  Any and every mistake could be their excuse to lay waste to everything Lucy wanted to hold onto.  With Wild Hunt, with Charles, with Musser.  🟂  “And your final exams?  For the semester’s end?  You can’t afford to miss class!”  “I can’t afford to not handle the stuff that needs handling,” Lucy replied.  “And what happens with school, then?  Do you have a clear vision?”  “I’m fourteen.  Does any fourteen year old have a clear vision?”  “Most fourteen year olds aren’t skipping class to kidnap a child in another school.”  “We turned her loose.  We had to.  We talked about it, we couldn’t hold onto her.  They would’ve organized a retaliation.  Because they had to.”  “And that’s supposed to make me feel better?” her mom asked her.  “If you told me you had goals and you were chasing them, I think I could do this.  I could support that, in some capacity, my heart would rest easy.  Please just give me something, Lucy.”  “Can’t home be the one place I don’t need to give something?” Lucy asked.  She felt like she’d break into tears.  “Because every day, all day, it feels like I have to hold myself to special standards.  With classmates, with teachers like Mr. Sitton and Mr. Bader.  I feel- I feel fucking scrutinized, every day, all day.”  “We’re not talking about that.  We’re-”  “I’m talking about it!” Lucy raised her voice.  “I’m talking about it being on me to manage things, to keep my friends safe, to save local Others, to represent us with visitors.  I’ve gotta give everything at school, and I’m going back to that but it’s a lot.  I have to watch things with Mia because she’s a friend and I have to maintain that and I also have to be careful because that’s a whole group where if I screw up, I might get frozen out.  And I don’t want to get frozen out.  I need to be sure I give to Wallace, and- and- his mom’s on the other side of anything I do, and if I forget his birthday or give him a crummy Christmas present, I feel like she’s going to judge me from the other side of it.”  “This is stuff Dr. Mona’s meant to help with.”  “I have to give her stuff too.  I have to share, but it has to be the right stuff, and if there’s something practice-related I have to frame it right, in half-truths, and work really hard to avoid conveying the wrong ideas to her, because I know she’s putting pieces together in the back of her mind, and figuring out what adds up and what doesn’t add up.  Dr. Mona doesn’t fix anything.  She just helps me handle stuff.”  “It doesn’t sound like you’re handling stuff.”  “I just need- I need home to be a place where there aren’t so many more expectations.  More all-or-nothings.”  “I want that for you too, but I also- I hate being the bad mom, Lucy.”  “You’re not a bad mom,” Lucy replied, looking at her mom and then looking away.  “I feel like I’m being put in a position where I’m the bad guy, over and over.  I don’t know if I’m holding onto the wrong things, or if I’m going to regret not holding on tighter, ten years from now.  Verona certainly made me feel like I put my foot in it.”  “About?”  “Boys.  Dating.”  Lucy raised her eyebrows, nodding.  She wanted to say more, but the feeling of hurt combined with the weight of everything else kind of took the levity out of it.  “That’d do it.”  “Is it the right thing to say you don’t need to worry about school?  Because if you repeat a grade, in the end-”  “I don’t think I’m there yet.”  “Not this semester, but next?  Over and over again, I hear that if a student falls behind in school, they don’t catch back up.  You’re supposed to be learning the tools you need next year, and I’m already- am I doing this wrong?  You’re so focused on avoiding the worst case scenarios, I’m not sure there’s a best case anymore.  What happens if you keep doing this, and you can’t keep up in school?  Do you lose Mia and Wallace when you’re a grade behind and you can’t tell them why?  Do you lose life opportunities?”  Lucy shrugged.  “Is it a one time thing?” her mom asked.  “Missing school?”  “Probably not.  We missed classes when we were fighting off the seventy invading practitioners.  This is going to be worse.”  Her mom sighed.  Lucy hated seeing her mom like this, but she wasn’t sure what to say or do.  “School is salvageable?” her mom asked.  “I’ll pass even if I bomb everything.  I don’t think I’ll bomb everything.  Just a couple exams in the next couple days, then I’m clear until next semester.”  “If I agree to let up on school, take that off your plate, can I put something smaller on it, in its place?” her mom asked.  “Maybe, yeah.”  “Talk to Avery and Verona.  I think Verona’s in a good place.  She might relish the chance to be your backup, for once, instead of you being hers.  Avery- I don’t know as much about how she’s doing, but… ask.  Share.  If you’re strained and they’re equipped to ease that strain, take advantage of that.”  “I think they’re strained too, or they’re going to be.”  “Ask.  Share.”  Lucy nodded.  “Connor told me he feels like he’s doing half a job, with Avery, because he’s dividing it with his wife.  He’s going to talk to Verona.  I think he’d be eager to talk to you.”  Lucy nodded again.  “Okay.  That’d feel weird, but okay.”  “Second thing?  Besides asking for support?  I need a goal.  Something you’re after, for five or ten years from now.  A dream.  A vision.  Verona’s pretty good at that.  What do you want and what are you after?”  Lucy nodded.  “Hug?  Or are you mad at me?”  Lucy accepted the hug.  “Not mad.”  “Oh good.  Did better than I did with Verona, I guess.  She was needling and hounding me because I said the wrong things about dating.”  “She’ll do that.”  Lucy squeezed her mom.  “I remember when your dad died.”  “Mom-”  “And it was really hard.  Really dark.  And there were expectations on me.  You guys, of course.  Not all expectations are bad, you’ll always be my priorities.  Work.  Family- your dad’s family.  Who were- they had been my family.  A found one, because I barely interacted with your grandparents.  I don’t interact with your grandfather, outside of the occasional call.  Friends had their opinions about what I should do, and how I should grieve.”  Lucy nodded.  “All of that.  It feels like drowning, and all of it pushes you deeper.  It seems like it’s all you can do to get up there, and get a gulp of air into your lungs.  But it’s tiring, fighting.  You make sacrifices.  You let things drop.  I let work drop.  The repercussions of that weren’t immediate, but they caught up with me.  It wasn’t until Connor gave me a helping hand that I got back where I wanted to be.  As embarrassing and frustrating as that was.  I don’t know if that makes sense.  The feelings tied to that.”  “It makes sense,” Lucy said.  “It was a long, hard few years between losing my job and getting another.”  “I noticed.”  “I know you notice.”  Her mom kissed the earring.  “I don’t want you to be in that situation.  I had to realize it’s not just about staying afloat.  It’s about paying enough attention to see a light on the shore, and realize you can’t just thrash and get through things day by day.  You need to swim for shore.  To have something waiting for you there.”  “Yeah?  What was it?”  “Paul.”  “That worked out, huh?”  “Did and didn’t.  Maybe he was what I needed right then, to feel wanted and loved outside of the want and love you get from being a parent of a five and nine year old.  We bought a house, and I wouldn’t ever have done that on my own, I don’t think.  And it’s tough to pay for alone, but it’s a home for all of us.  I’m willing to put in the work to have this on my shore.”  “Yeah.”  “I told Booker a lot of that.  Bits and pieces along the way.  I don’t want to dump things on you, but I want you to know I’ve been where you are.  And you are my daughter.  You’re similar.”  Lucy nodded.  “Now what do you need?” her mom asked.  “I stayed up late with the market.”  “I know you did.”  “And I’m pretty wiped.  Surveillance, running around trying to make sure everyone knows what’s going on, without stepping on the wrong toes.  Training with Guilherme.  Talking to you.”  “Nap?”  “Is that okay?”  “Go.  Do you want me to wake you for dinner?”  “Ummm…”  “I’ll put it in the oven to stay warm if you’re not up.  But I’ll go to work, so you know where to find it if it’s not in the oven.”  “Okay.  Thanks.”  She went upstairs, changing into pyjama pants, and lay down in bed.  Between the fatigue and the soreness from fighting, she was out before she’d fully pulled the covers around herself.  🟂  A bit of peace and quiet.  She used a pick with the guitar, sitting with the sunlight shining in over the backyard bright and warm against her front.  She tried to find the sequence of notes, working with her fingers, murmuring the tune, restarting when she tripped up.  A few times, she didn’t try at all, working with her fingers.  He sat down behind her, reaching over to put one hand over hers, helping with the sequence.  Until they had it.  He hummed as her murmurs became singing.  She wasn’t very good, and she wasn’t great at the guitar part either, but he was decent at the guitar and way worse at the singing.  So she played, with his occasional help, and he hummed instead of singing.  She could feel the low vibration against her back.  When she had it, he got up.  She didn’t want him to.  He kept humming.  She shifted to laying on her back, guitar at her stomach,  looking up at him, as he went to the kitchen, getting water.  “I’m not going to drink out of a dog bowl if I can help it,” he said.  She smiled, and she sang, playing.  He didn’t have that haunted look in his eyes, in that moment, as he cleaned the glass and put it away.  As a dog, he padded his way across the floor.  He settled down, lying in the sun by her leg, moving his chin up to rest on her leg.  She played until she’d done all the parts of the song she knew, then she played the first parts over again, making sure she had it down okay.  Room for improvement.  She moved her head up, carefully, so she woudln’t jostle him.  He’d fallen asleep like that.  So she lay there, guitar flat against her stomach, hands keeping it steady, head partially turned, watching as a warm summer wind blew a few stray leaves and cherry blossoms into the dining room, just inside the back door.  The music continued, even though she’d stopped.  🟂  She lay in bed, a bit cold, even though her mom had come in to move the covers back over her.  She had her music in, and it pressed awkwardly against her left ear, which didn’t have the earring.  It played indistinct, until she fixed it where it sat ajar.  The dog tag had a sharp bit that jabbed at her.  She felt heavy, her brain weighty in her skull, like she hadn’t slept or dreamt at all, and it was letting her know it was overloaded, still.  It was dark, and she had no idea if it was six o’clock in the evening or three in the morning or six o’clock in the morning.  She made herself move, and she checked, while pulling the dog tag out of her shirt, so it dangled on the outside.  It was midnight.  She was probably not going to sleep normally tonight, because she’d ‘napped’ for as long as she had.  That’s not my dream, she thought.  It’s not, it wasn’t, it doesn’t count.  She went downstairs and she found the oven cold.  Made sense.  The leftovers were in the fridge though, and warming it in the microwave wasn’t so bad.  While the microwave did its work, humming loudly, providing some of the only light in the dark kitchen, she looked at the spot on the floor where the dream had taken place.  A dream, but not her dream.  Different words for different meanings.  Her mom wanted her to find a dream.  Something in the future to strive towards.  Not something in the past that she couldn’t reasonably achieve.  John had had to go, to save his Dog Tags.  He’d had to go because the Carmine had been killed.  The only way that dream would be possible would be if Charles hadn’t killed the Carmine Beast.  And Lucy would have had to awaken for other reasons.  Maybe because people were nosing around about the Hungry Choir, and they needed representatives.  It didn’t matter.  It was a mere fantasy.  Her mom wanted her to find a dream.  And she was mad enough, she found, that a perfectly nice dream had been rendered mere fantasy, that it kind of spurred her on.  Past the heaviness in her head, past the cold that leaked in through the walls, and past the weight of knowing she had three possible overwhelming dangers to confront in the coming days or weeks.  While the microwave finished, she turned on the bright kitchen lights.  She got books, and she got her laptop, and by the time she was underway, fork in a microwave safe container filled with lasagna, the table was covered in old materials and notes, and blank papers she planned to fill with new and relevant ones.  Rule of law wording in practice.  Competitive clauses of Establishment.  Capital E.  Petitions and challenges.  Orders of operation; hierarchies of greater powers.  Guilherme could give her an edge in a fight.  And that edge could matter against any of her enemies.  She’d find a similar kind of edge on other fronts.

      "               <Document: {'content': '    Lucy’s leg bounced nervously as she waited.  Her earring didn’t catch any imminent approaches.  It was dark out, and the snow that blew around was wet.  Rook had set up her greenhouse-like construction over the roof, and where snow met glass, it melted, leaving moisture.  Moisture caught light, including the light from the town and the light from the ski hills on either side of Kennet, and between a light fog, a bit of frost, and that moisture, it made the outside world seem dulled by one measure and turned glittering and dreamlike by two others.  It sucked that Musser wasn’t closer, or further.  There wasn’t enough to hash out in terms of news, considering the market, keeping tabs on the St. Victor’s students, or reports on the Wild Hunt.  They’d talked, and they’d run out of official meeting stuff, and now they could only chat and wait, tense.  Verona didn’t seem like it was affecting her, but she was rubbing at her hand.  Avery was chatting quickly with her dad, while Rook had gotten up to talk to Hollow Yen.  “Did you run the Promenade?” Lucy asked Avery, as Avery finished with her dad and walked over to the roof’s edge.  Avery shook her head.  “I postponed.  They’re antsy, but they want to take a serious shot at it, so when we’re done here, barring any big emergencies that we have to handle, I’ll take a quick break and handle that.”  “Imagine if you got some godly boon and were all, ‘oh fuck, should’ve done that sooner’,” Verona said.  “I don’t think it would be ‘godly’,” Miss said.  “Wait, do you know?” Avery asked.  “If I could go and look, I could give you some sense of it, but I’ve only passed through and heard more through word of mouth.  It doesn’t have the hallmarks of something that would give you power in that sense.”  “Hmmm.  Do you have any idea what it would give?” Avery asked.  “Sootsleeves would be a better person to ask,” Miss said.  “She’s managed the boons and gifts a practitioner can collect.”  “We’ve had conversations,” Avery replied.  “Hmm.  Anyone else?  Sootsleeves is pretty touchy about the subject.”  “I could point you to some Others to talk to.”  And that was the conversation.  “Nothing to do but wait, huh?” Lucy said, before realizing she’d said it out loud.  “We’ve extended an invitation,” Rook replied, “and it would be bad karma to then interfere with him in any way.  Even plotting actively against him could be an issue.”  “Can you exploit that?” Verona asked.  “Accept an offer to meet someone from halfway around the world, take your time?”  She craned around, looking at Rook, Miss, Toadswallow, then Matthew.  “I don’t honestly know,” Matthew said.  “Is that ever going to come up?”  “It’s not about what’s practical,” Verona said.  She winced as she shifted position in her chair, touching her injury.  “It’s about understanding what we’re doing, how things work.  If it does work, then that’s a whole direction to take future stuff.”  “My dad would’ve loved to have you as a daughter.  Ambition, a head for this stuff,” Matthew said.  “Being sore like I am, the idea of becoming immortal or doing the Heartless thing Matthew’s dad did sure is tempting,” Verona said, shifting position again, like she couldn’t get comfortable.  “Preying on people though,” Avery pointed out.  “I’d have been so shitty without you guys,” Verona said.  “My almost-first thought is the ‘daughter’ part would be sticky,” Lucy said.  “Sorry, Matthew, I know I don’t have any basis for that.”  “No, that’s fair, I guess.”  Lucy shrugged.  “It’s just an assumption that feels really reasonable when talking about most non-first generation practitioners.  That they’re shitty to women and girls.”  “You should’ve seen the Whitts and other families at the Musser house,” Avery added.  “Definitely seems to be a thing.”  “I wonder,” Matthew said.  “Never crossed my mind, but I never really saw him with many women.  It was him and me, mostly.”  “How old was he?” Miss asked.  “I have no idea.  But I think he’d been around a while.  Since ‘the war’ and he didn’t mean the Vietnam war.”  “Immortals and those who are functionally immortal can be behind the times.”  “True.  Damn.”  “You’re just not that inquisitive a soul, huh, Matthew?” Verona asked.  Lucy elbowed Verona.  “It’s more like…” Matthew groaned, sitting back.  “…if the brain’s a house full of memories, then sometimes it’s better to turn some of the lights off.”  “Heartless practice?”  “Once.  But mostly repression.”  “If it helps,” Louise said, “I think you’re doing darn good on that front.”  There was some general chatter, none of it especially directed at Lucy.  She drank her tea.  Lucy studied the pair, trying to see if there were any hints of a deeper connection.  She honestly couldn’t tell.  Maybe there were reasons.  Like Edith still being out there.  Jealous ex-wives were one thing, but a jealous ex-wife with the ability to manage echoes and set fires at will?  It got her thinking about Wallace, just because that was her relationship, and Wallace’s mom, and the shadow that had cast over things.  She looked over at Avery’s dad, but Avery’s mom was still in Thunder Bay…  So was Avery’s girlfriend.  Verona and Jeremy had broken their friendship-plus off, and as far as Lucy knew, Verona hadn’t gone chasing anything else.  Toadswallow’s partner was gone, back with her practitioner, at least for now…  “It’s so hard to hold onto things,” Lucy said.  “What’s that?” Avery asked.  “Thinking aloud.  It’s so hard to balance all this with actual life.  In the movies and TV shows, usually it’s a few mishaps and stuff, or one episode that gets the special superhero struggling at school thing, or whatever they are.  Alien, robot, secret pirate.  But then the episode is over, show moves on, and they go back to doing okay.”  “How were your grades?” Avery asked.  “I passed.  You?”  “Worse than I’ve done since the first semester at high school, but I’m at peace with it.”  “More other stuff.  Like… are Nibble and Chloe the only relationship that’s not, I dunno, patchy?”  “Snowdrop and Cherrypop?” Avery asked.  Lucy looked over.  Cherrypop was fast asleep, lying in Snowdrop’s fur.  “Not so romantic, though, is it?”  “Pshhh, romance,” Verona murmured.  “Are you okay, though?  Both of you?” Avery asked.  “Got some of my best grades ever, faster than ever, shop’s underway, setting up the nightmare market.  Just, you know, Wild Hunt of the Winter Court, feels like guillotines bigger than freaking Kennet are hanging over our heads, you know?”  “Yeah.”  Avery looked at Lucy.  “You?”  “No.”  “No?”  “Not okay.  But let’s get through tonight.  Either the one guillotine falls and we deal after, or we get one out of the way.”  “Hey,” Avery said, tapping Lucy’s shoulder with a fist.  “The idea we think we can maybe get one out of the way is pretty crazy, given what we’re up against, don’t you think?”  Lucy nodded.  “Speaking of?” Reggie- Hollow Yen asked.  They were looking over the edge.  Lucy’s leg bounced nervously.  She made it stop.  “Bread out of the oven,” Rook told Reggie.  She walked over to the far corner of the roof, where the Vice Principal, Stew Mullen, Oldbodies, and Bitter Street Witch had gathered, talking quietly.  Rook returned to the table and began refreshing drinks.  People took their seats and sat for about thirty seconds before Lucy heard the first steps on the fire escape with her earring.  “Good luck, everyone,” Miss murmured.  “Goblins?  Be good,” Toadswallow said.  There were some nods.  With her earring, she got a sense of Musser with his familiars- the way they followed his footsteps sounded to her special hearing like geese flying in a ‘v’ formation looked.  There were others.  She heard the footsteps and counted them.  The familiars were being asked to wait at the foot of the stairs.  Musser ascended without his familiars.  Musser was first through.  Lucy had seen that kind of dominance game with the people of Kennet below, making an issue of who was first through.  There were some who were unfashionably late, sometimes, but that felt really childish to Lucy, and stupid.  She didn’t see the point.  They almost always moved on without that person around, and it put the person in a bad position.  He wore a red winter coat, with a thick wool scarf worn like a fucking ascot, and had snowflakes in his hair, with more stuck to the frames of his glasses, though they avoided sticking to the glass.  “A white rabbit told me to come,” he said.  “I assume rules of hospitality are in order?”  “They are,” Rook said.  She set a drink and bread down.  “You know, I’ve never once known Luna to not introduce herself, why not just admit your memory’s terrible?” Lucy asked.  “Easy,” Toadswallow grunted.  Someone was behind Musser, but she didn’t recognize him.  He had a similar vibe, expensive and put together, with a preppy gray wool overcoat, expensive blond-brown hair, but he looked like he could’ve been a member of a boy band other girls would squeal over.  Trim, slim, shorter, like a teenage boy fashion model who hadn’t ever lost that youthful look, and who now wore a carefully cultivated stubble to counter how naturally young he looked.  Eliana Graubard wasn’t a huge surprise.  She was followed by a large doll with hair rigged up with ornaments that didn’t seem to fit any nation Lucy knew.  The clothing was similarly expensive.  It made her think a bit about the Fae that had stormed into her room.  Big, and dressed up in a way that made her feel as if it was broadcasting ‘I spent thousands on this outfit, I’m wearing it to a warzone, and I can do that because I’m good enough to know it won’t be ruined.’  Which didn’t change that they’d done pretty well against Eliana Graubard the last time around.  Was she bringing a bigger metaphorical gun with her this time around?  Digging into family reserves?  Lucy recognized the fourth person to come up.  No.  Mousy, frail-looking, and tall, unassuming despite her stature in the community.  She didn’t have an expensive haircut- it looked like she cut her own hair and washed it one day a week less than she needed to.  There was a situation like the doll, where it might wear expensive clothes because it was powerful enough it could fend off trouble and not ruin them…  There was also a situation like this, where there was no need to care about a coat with a purple-black stain at the lapel.  Nobody would say shit to Ms. Durocher.  “Abraham Musser, making a preliminary visit before a planned claim next month,” Musser said.  “With me are Clark Hall, Eliana Graubard, and Marie Durocher.”  Rook indicated the end of the table closest to the fire escape.  Introductions were made.  Tea, wine, and bread were provided.  “You’ve sided with Musser, Ms. Durocher?” Avery asked.  “You can consider me a concerned neutral party, who has reason to cooperate with him.”  “What reason is that?” Lucy asked her.  “The Carmine Exile situation.  Charles.  I have to admit, I’m surprised he isn’t here,” Durocher replied.  “We’re not with Charles, you know,” Lucy replied.  “I know.  But I’m surprised.  I shouldn’t be, I remember he was shy, before.  Thoughtful, careful.  I thought after being bold enough to do this, he’d be bold enough to come.”  “Are you trying to summon him?” Miss asked.  “If you bait him like that, I could see him paying a visit.”  Ms. Durocher smiled.  Did she actually think she could put up a fight against Charles, if it came down to it?  “I’ll ask, because you have quite a rabble here, who’s in charge?” Musser asked.  “I would know from my last visit, but I know dynamics have changed.”  Lucy had to fight from keeping her leg from bouncing.  The latent frustration was boiling up, and she worried she’d say something snarky that wouldn’t help things.  “It’s a committee leadership, with members of multiple factions, but everyone gets a voice,” Louise said.  Musser didn’t look impressed.  “You’ve gathered a large number of Others,” Ms. Durocher observed, turning toward Lucy, Verona, and Avery.  “You say that like it was us,” Avery replied.  “We’re not in charge or anything, we’re not binding anyone.  But we span three realms, we’ve got a big market that ties into everything.  Others come.  Others were made in the founding, or when Kennet below happened.”  “If you had to, could you name every last one?” Durocher asked.  “Why does that matter?” Matthew asked.  “Curiosity.  I have several yardsticks I use to analyze situations.  Others gravitate toward where Others are.  Goblins gather near other goblins.  I’m curious if you’ve passed the point where this town metaphorically exhales, and then inhales, and comes away with a net change of more Others.”  “If you want to see for yourself, there’s a city spirit,” Verona said.  “Oh!  Interesting.”  “Just to let you know, Charles has a policy, apparently, of finding an excuse to gainsay anyone who approaches him or members of his conspiracy,” Lucy added.  “City-spirit-slash-doppleganger included.”  “Oh?  I’d ask him to make an exception,” Ms. Durocher said.  “If I’m gainsaid or forsworn, about one to two hundred practitioners around the world will have to scramble to clean up the messes that pop up.”  “Primevals?” Verona asked.  “Among other powers.  Charles knows.  A part of me wanted to see what you’ve been creating.  It seems as if you’re trying to build something big.”  “Some things fell into place,” Miss said.  “We were lucky enough to have some good minds of the right types, and those with big ideas and the willingness to see it through.”  “Kind of like what you were doing, Mr. Musser,” Lucy said.  “You were lucky, found good minds, found people with big ideas and drive.  With one key difference.”  “Prior relationship with the Carmine Exile, instead of prior enmity?”  “Broader than that,” Lucy told him.  She shrugged.  “You.”  Musser sniffed.  “We’ve got, well, us.  Community and support and-”  “I’m not here to be preached at by a little girl.”  “We’ve broken bread,” Rook told him.  “Many of us will have things to say, and we expect to be heard.  You will, I’m sure, have your declarations.  We will be obliged to hear them out.”  “Go on, Lucy,” Toadswallow croaked.  She hadn’t actually scripted this.  She would’ve been fine poking at a weakness and getting a curt, defensive response.  Wordplay was like swordplay and Guilherme, who’d skipped tonight, had tried to convey that at a few different points.  Against a threat like this, there were worse things than getting a few key jabs in and getting away unscathed.  Over time, they could add up.  “When things get hard, we protect each other-”  She glanced at Grandfather and Horseman.  “Provide resources, shuffle things around, we get angry on each other’s behalf.  I’m not saying you don’t.  I know that’s a function of what you tried to set up.  But when we talk to the people at the edges of what you’re doing, who are losing faith or hurt, or struggling, or captured-”  “By you?” Eliana Graubard asked.  “Sure.  Or by Others.  Or by their own families.  We ask what they’re doing, and you come up.  It’s attaching their fortunes to yours, it’s faith in you, it’s fear of you.”  “It’s called leadership.”  “Tyranny,” Rook commented.  “It’s on you though, if it’s your leadership,” Lucy pressed.  “If I may interject?” Mr. Hall asked.  “To clarify a possible misunderstanding?”  Lucy glanced at Miss and Rook.  The rules of hospitality-  “We’ll be sure to allow you to finish what you’re saying after.”  Damn.  “You may,” Miss told him.  “I can testify, in my efforts to get the lay of the land before I got involved, and in anticipation of lines of attack like this, I asked various figures in Abraham Musser’s group, and there was a majority agreement that the fault of the current situation lies at the feet of the Carmine Exile, not Musser.”  “Can second,” Eliana Graubard added.  Verona had her phone out.  “I also formally request that, if we’re holding to the rules of hospitality, that we stick to the rules held by families all around the civilized world.  In various forms, for hundreds of years, no reading at the table, and for as long as cell phones have been in common use, no phones at the table,” Mr. Hall said.  “It’s our table,” Rook said.  “That remains a slight.  I’d like that noted for the record.”  “Noted for the record,” Miss said.  Shitty thing was, according to what Lucy had read, that mattered.  Who was this guy?  Lucy had only barely finished the thought when she saw Verona put her phone down on the table.  She’d opened the Atheneum Arrangement, and looked up Mr. Clark Hall.

Level: Advanced  Schools: Contract, Deals, Law  He’d written books on contract magic and Law practices.  She’d learned some things from Mr. Harless and he probably saw this guy or this guy’s family as the people to look to.  Verona slid her phone down the table toward Matthew.  Lucy felt that like a physical blow, and turned in her seat as she felt it, adjusting posture, gripping the table’s edge, to better face Musser.  No way did she want to lose momentum.  “Musser’s situation with the Carmine Exile is his problem, not ours, and it doesn’t undermine my point that this counts against him.  Durocher is here, she’s, as far as I can tell, not being bothered.”  “Be clearer about what you’re asserting,” Mr. Hall said.  “Get bent.  I was clear enough.  You make a clearer counterpoint, because if I compare Musser and us and how things ended up, things are a mess.  And you can’t say that’s on the Carmine Exile, because the Carmine had a prior relationship with Musser and with Durocher, as far as I know, that relationship wasn’t that different back then, and now he’s getting his ass kicked and she isn’t.  The common part of this is the guy with the gold-rimmed glasses.”  “Okay.  For the record, first thing, just to get it out of the way, I formally request that we tone down the vitriol and language.  It’s a slight, it runs against-”  “Rule of discourse, Mr. Hall,” Verona cut in.  “We swear at this table all the time.”  “There are goblins present, sir,” Sir Toadswallow croaked.  “Admittedly, not something I have the most experience with-”  Write a fucking book about it, Lucy thought, glaring.  “-Withdrawn.”  Lucy smiled.  “Second, there is a clear and evidenced course of action by the Carmine Exile.  He’s getting meaner, he’s getting more ruthless, he’s acting against his own prior goals and beliefs, he was a broken, Forsworn man when he became Carmine Exile, and he took on a mantle of power that’s inherently corrupting and violent.  I can testify that Abraham Musser had a working truce with the Carmine Exile, which you yourselves witnessed in action, extending from late August to October, that was breached by the Carmine Exile through no fault of Abraham Musser.”  “No fault?  He led more than sixty-five practitioners in a violent and reckless attack on the seat of the Carmine Exile’s power!” Lucy exclaimed.  “He acted on the final stages of plan of action that had its groundwork and initial actions taken well ahead of the Carmine Exile taking his throne and the making of that truce.  He sought to take a town to secure it-”  “Against the Carmine!  He literally talked about stopping the Carmine.”  “You may surmise that, but we can point to something far clearer.  The truce kept the Carmine Exile from gainsaying Abraham Musser.  If the truce was breached by Abraham Musser in a failure of leadership, as you suggest, then the order of events would have been Abraham Musser attacking, the Carmine Exile responding by thoroughly gainsaying him, as he’s taken to doing with wanton and reckless abandon.  Both Carmine and Musser were moving against each other.  That’s allowed.”  “I’m losing track of this,” Avery admitted.  Lucy and Mr. Hall started talking at the same time.  Lucy leaned forward, hands gripping the edge of the wrought metal table, her chair squeaking against the floor, and Mr. Hall relented.  Lucy’s cut arm and stitches throbbed as she clenched the table.  Lucy answered Avery, “Musser is like a guy who started out with nine hundred, ninety nine million, nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety dollars, and is really proud at earning ten bucks and closing the deal on becoming a billionaire.”  “Started halfway to home plate and acts like he hit a home run,” Avery added.  “Sure,” Lucy said.  “And he still bit off more than he could chew, he got fancy and he choked.  He failed, that’s on him, when he had so much.  He screwed up, he tried to take what I’m sure most would agree is an unreasonably sized amount of territory, he went up against the Carmine Exile, a higher power, he got reckless, he was a shitty leader and we keep hearing how shitty he was and is, and he fucking choked.”  She met Musser’s eyes as she said it, letting the frustration of the last few days, weeks, and months lace every word.  Mr. Hall remained calm, by contrast.  “Abraham Musser undertook a plan he’d worked on and discussed thoroughly with his peers years before the Carmine Exile was even a consideration.  He made a truce to delay an emergent and obvious threat, and did what was fair and reasonable during a truce with a reckless higher power, which is to prepare and anticipate.  The Carmine Exile taking power and doing what it did was unpredictable and next to impossible to anticipate.  You might as well take your hypothetical almost-billionaire and blame him for his other hundreds of millions getting struck by lightning and set ablaze while he reaches for his last dollar.”  “I can blame that guy if he’s so caught up and rushed in what he’s doing-”  “Again, reckless, emergent, and immediate threat, that appeared unexpectedly, even to you, in the midst of his plans.”  “-he didn’t protect his shit.  If you’re so rushed that your money, your everything is in a position to be set on fire by a so-called freak accident, didn’t put it in a bank, didn’t insure it, didn’t plan- hell, by the timeline you’re talking about, Mr. Hall, he had months he knew about this threat and didn’t secure things.  If this is a threat he has to plan and prepare for, don’t leave shit out in the metaphorical thunderstorm for months and get surprised if it’s ruined.”  “There was a reckless, emergent, immediate threat in a higher power gone rogue.  You cited rule of discourse earlier, I’ll point to the same ideas.  Again, I talked to various families across this territory, across Musser’s contingent.  Just as rule of discourse is based on what everyone thinks and does in speaking, the fact the majority involved don’t blame him and are still willing to work with him -insofar as they’re able- puts this debate heavily in my favor.  I polled his people, they disagree with you.  If we’re talking about leadership, the people being led are a very important voice.  Your voice is a lonely one, by contrast.”  “She’s not that alone,” Avery said.  “Still.”  “You’re falling back on majority rule?” Lucy asked.  “That is the world we live in- Lucy, was it?  As a visible minority, you should know.”  Oh, she hated him.  “Don’t bring my skin into it.”  “I’ll change the subject then.  To answer something you said earlier… your analogy.  The millionaire on the cusp of being a billionaire, or the man who started partway to home plate and had to take only a few steps.”  “Is this what tonight’s going to be?” Matthew asked.  “We start with an accusation that Musser, the guy with a coalition in shambles, is a bad leader, and then get increasingly granular, arguing every few words and statements?”  “I love granular,” Mr. Hall said, smiling.  “If Lucy there wants to forfeit her point, we can move on, but I think we all know this is a tone setter, and a setup for later points.  I’m not going anywhere, I’m being well paid, I am perfectly willing to fight you over every last grain.  Now, Lucy’s made an argument we had to put aside, I feel it’s important to refute it, or else this becomes less about the spirit and letter of the law, and who can make the most points the fastest, to see what slips through.”  “Isn’t that the world we live in?” Miss asked.  “Fortunately, those protective of the rule and spirit of Law have prepared us against that.  There is precedent and support for both of my points.  For majority rule, and for calls to order against tides of falsehood.”  Lucy really hated him.  “If I may continue?  No, let’s reword that.  I may continue, by precedent.  Say otherwise and we can litigate that, and you’ll be arguing against centuries of-”  “Continue,” Rook told him.  “Thank you.  If I could get a refill on my drink, actually?”  “Of course.”  This was shitty.  It was a shitty she kept running into, too.  Going up against heavyweights.  A lot of Guilherme’s training had been to teach her to fight people who were bigger, because she was small.  People who were stronger, because while she was reasonably athletic, she wasn’t going to beat the average person in an arm wrestling contest.  But it went past that.  She was up against verbal heavyweights.  Winter Fae, who had centuries of experience and if she ever even came close to winning an argument, they could pull a horn out of their fucking asses and blow on it and they’d call a fucking inquisition of stupidly strong Fae down on Kennet, drag her off to Winter or something, and that would be it.  Musser, who could pull absolute bullshit.  ‘I’m a winner so let’s cut to the chase and just say I won’.  And this guy.  It didn’t matter that she was right.  They were powerful, privileged, and protected.  “Thank you for the tea,” Mr. Hall said, putting his cup down.  “Had a lot of salty foods on the trip over, I was parched.  Don’t want to lose my voice.”  “Carry on,” Matthew said.  “If you’ll allow me a moment to confer?” Mr. Hall asked, leaning over to Musser.  Musser immediately put a hand up, the backs of his gloved fingers against Hall’s mouth.  He leaned in close.  “Lucy there has enhanced hearing, by way of implement.  Mind what you say.”  “Noted.  I won’t be specific.  But about things you shared in confidence…”  “I know what you mean.  You may reference it, but mind you avoid specifics.  You swore oaths.”  Hall leaned back, took another sip of tea, thinking, then addressed the table.  “The assertion was made that Musser did not earn what he has.  I can testify, he has.”  “Are you actually saying he’s not from a rich family?” Lucy asked.  “He is.”  “But he earned everything he has?”  “He did.”  “What, he won the approval of his dad and that earns him everything he got handed?” Lucy asked.  “He did win the approval of his father, and that is a factor from certain angles.”  “Okay, if we’re allowed to point to majority rule bullshit, I think we can look at what the majority views a standard wage and ‘earning’ is, and there is absolutely no fucking way that Musser put in the hours to earn what he apparently has.  Jets, multiple million-dollar properties, libraries, your -I‘m sure- expensive ass.”  Mr. Hall smiled.  “Arguments can be easily made that the majority recognizes vast disparities in wealth and that many earn disproportionately more for a given amount of work than others-”  “If you argue that that the majority of people think it’s legit a trust fund baby can get millions for doing practically nothing because of that disparity, or that they consider it fair earning, I’m liable to gainsay your ass,” Lucy told him.  “Amen,” Louise commented from the sidelines.  “I’m not arguing that, as a matter of fact.  I said you could easily make the arguments.  But you’re arguing against a point I didn’t make.  Allowing for reasonable variance based on time and place, and allowing for things like investment of income and pursuit of ventures on the side to turn one dollar into ten, so to speak, Musser here earned every dollar he has.”  “Again, his winning over his family-”  “Not what I’m arguing.  A facet, but it’s not at the heart of this.”  “Just to be clear-”  “Please.”  “He earned every dollar he has, according to you.  You’re actually saying he worked for every last dollar.”  “He did.  At reasonable rates, allowing for variance, even, and there will always be some degree of exploitation, investment…”  “You’re also saying he was given everything that he has by his family.”  “He was.”  “But he didn’t earn what he has by way of winning over his family or working to get them to hand over that money?”  “Exactly so.  Being in his family’s good graces and being allowed to continue was a facet, but it wasn’t at the heart of his earning.  Obviously, if he was kicked out of the family, that would change a lot.”  “There is a significant fucking contradiction here, Mr. Hall,” Lucy said, leaning forward.  “If he was given what he has by his family he didn’t fucking earn it, did he?  We’re using ‘earned’ as in he worked for the hours a reasonable person would deem necessary and valid, not cheating his way through?”  “Correct.”  Lucy sat back.  “We were just talking about Heartless practitioners, before,” Verona said.  “Are you immortal, Mr. Musser?”  “I’m not at liberty to disclose what was shared with me in confidence,” Mr. Hall said.  “It’s fine.  I will live and die as my father and grandfather did before me,” Musser said.  “Is this some bullshit claim practice?  You did some ritual to be able to lay claim to the family fortunes as if you technically worked for it?”  “Again, I am not at liberty to disclose,” Mr. Hall replied.  Mrs. Durocher looked a little restless.  We’re in the same fucking boat, because I can’t stand sitting here and listening to this bullshit.  Mrs. Durocher’s restlessness was probably more frustration with the deeper legal conversation being a legal conversation.  “If you can’t back it up, then I don’t see why it should count.”  “If it helps refute accusations made against Mr. Musser here, I can stake my word on this.”  “That Musser was given what he has by family, and did not earn it, but also earned it, but the two aren’t connected by some thread like him earning his father’s approval?”  “Not how I would phrase it, but in that neighborhood.”  “And you can’t give evidence?”  “No, but again, I stake my word on this.  In lieu of gainsaying you, Lucy, by way of Law practice, I instead request to spirits and powers that this be set forward, so it may count in future deliberations against you tonight, when spirits and higher powers are weighing your arguments against ours and finding themselves less sure.”  “If you’d like, you can challenge him,” Musser said.  “Challenge him over his word on this, swear the oaths to keep the confidences he does, and litigate this.”  “On his bluff?” Matthew asked.  “If you think it’s a bluff,” Musser said.  He cut a bit of bread off, took some cheese, and took a bite, chasing it with red wine.  It wasn’t a bluff, Lucy knew.  There was no way a practitioner like this would chance everything on a bluff when up against a teenager who could do something impulsive out of anger, when she was pissed.  This was such bullshit.  “Questions of leadership and legitimacy set firmly aside, shall we begin?” Mr. Hall asked.  “If I may?  As Ellingson there initiated the prior discussion?  I’ll start us off,” Musser said.  “You may,” Rook said.  Still acting as arbiter and host.  “We’re faced with the reckless and dangerous Carmine Exile.  He’s designing powerful Others to counter specific practitioners.  The one possibility that strikes me is that it’s inevitable he comes for you.  If so, you should want to stop him.  Let me establish a Lordship.  After I claimed the Lordship, my niece Raquel Musser would be made interim lord, deferring power to me in much the same way the Carmine Exile’s lords defer power to him and the other judges.”  “Doesn’t sound very appealing,” Louise said.  “It’s the same deal you offered before, just slightly sweetened,” Lucy said.  Musser shook his head.  “Comparatively, it’s much sweeter, relatively, but let’s not get distracted.  Another possibility is that you’re on the Carmine’s side.  In that event, I see it as my responsibility to step in and keep you from doing further harm.  Raquel has worked with you, and signed a contract of unknown provenance, and action would have to be taken to protect the family against her.”  “You’re using your own niece as a pawn?” Avery’s dad asked.  “I would be protecting her after she’s made deals with a reckless group working in concert with the Carmine Exile.”  “There are other possibilities than those two,” Lucy said.  “One being that you’re a dangerous, crappy leader and we don’t want you to be in charge but we’re still not okay with him either.”  “You already litigated the question of my leadership and legitimacy and lost,” Musser replied.  “There’s another consideration.  On our way here, just outside your doorstep, even, I was confronted by an Other.  One who asked me to step into the shoes of a man who led a group against me, resisting my taking a Lordship, and to fight myself.”  “What about it?” Lucy asked.  “It was effective.  A trap meant for me.  The Carmine Exile is dangerous, and if he eventually comes for you, he may use similar methods against you too.  I suffered two setbacks before my eventual win.  It was pointed.  Mr. Hall had to call on some powers to get me here in a timely manner.”  “I think you mean you lost twice,” Lucy said.  Steps on the fire escape made her think one of his familiars had been called.  It was her mom, instead.  Not trying to be fashionably late- she’d had legit work.  Lucy smiled briefly at her mom, but she knew the smile didn’t reach her eyes.  Her mom walked past her to Connor’s side, leaning in, so he could give her the rundown.  “I prevailed.  I don’t think you, should you face the focused ire of that deranged, small little man, will prevail.  But I have to wonder if you’ll even try.”  “What makes you think we aren’t already?” Lucy asked.  “That you’re still here.  And the glasses I wear and my Sight are tuned to let me identify items and their value.  Their provenance.  Wouldn’t you know?  Someone here helped make it.  Her fingerprints were on it, so to speak.  Not the primary architect, but when Charles crafted the trap, she counseled.”  Crap.  “Musser,” Miss said.  “Let me finish, then I’ll let you have your turn again.  She conspired with Fernanda Whitt, who she spent time with at the Blue Heron before departing, expelled.  She interacted with McCauleigh Hennigar during McCauleigh’s long so-called imprisonment, and McCauleigh just rejected her family and the family’s involvement in my ongoing efforts.  She interacted with members of lesser families, such as Andrea Fulton, née Andrea Conrad, who have similarly conspired.  A reckoning is in order.  Verona Hayward.”  “Yo,” Verona replied.  “Technically it wasn’t Verona doing that conspiring,” Avery said.  “It was me.”  “She played her part.  Do let me continue.  Andrea Fulton can die and her daughter can be married off, they barely matter.  McCauleigh Hennigar can be married off overseas, to a husband who can temper her wild and aggressive spirit, and she will cease to be a consideration.  Her family agrees with the idea.  The Whitts are in a poor position after losing Alexander Belanger’s mentorship, and in exchange for my favor and funding, I do believe Chase will let me arrange a similar handling of Fernanda Whitt.”  “That’s monstrous,” Louise said.  “They’re children.”  “They are dangerous conspirators exacerbating a bad situation in dangerous times.”  Teenagers.  But it barely mattered.  Verona looked physically ill.  Like she had before she’d thrown up, after Bristow had gone off to the kitchens.  Lucy’s mom had arrived just in time for this.  “Ms. Durocher?” Lucy asked.  “Please don’t be cool with this.  A lot of these are your students.”  “I’m not,” Durocher replied.  “But for now, the subject is being expressed in terms of what can be, beliefs, nothing stated in absolute.”  “Yet,” Avery said.  Lucy added, “And when it’s stated in absolute, it’ll be too late.  Or will you draw a hard line and turn Musser into a smear when he tries?”  “If I said anything of the sort, I’d be taking a side-”  “Against someone who wants to sell off teenage girls for political gain because they disagree with him!” Lucy raised her voice, rising up out of her seat.  “Your students.  Your ex-students.”  “I know you have no cause to have faith in me, so I won’t ask you to try.  All I can say is I don’t take sides.”  “Can I ask that we lower our voices, hold to standards of decorum?” Mr. Hall asked.  “Fuck your decorum.  Fuck your so-called not taking sides,” Lucy said, angry now.  “Are you fucking done, Musser?  Said your piece?  Made your threats?”  “I have other individuals you should know are at risk due to their own malpractice and cooperation with dangerous groups like yourself.  People who’ve walked the line in a dangerous circumstance.  If we’re to establish order… Nicolette has worked with you and through you, the Carmine Exile.  Zed too, but in a more nebulous way.”  “And what do you have after?” Bitter Street Witch asked.  “You’d kill the women, children, and someone like Zed, who I’ve never heard a complaint about?”  Nicolette, Lucy thought.  The Bitter Street Witch wouldn’t want to sound sentimental, but it’d be Nicolette who provoked her to speaking up.  “I’d kill and marry off traitors to those who can curb their tendencies.  To achieve some semblance of order.  I don’t expect this to be easy.”  “You call that order?” Rook asked.  “Let’s be clear, it’s tyranny.”  “When a situation is this bad, there is no way to create order from chaos without seeming terrible,” Musser replied.  “A surgeon cutting out cancer may seem like a butcher to those who don’t understand.”  “To turn things around, a butcher with an ego may imagine himself as intricate and skilled as a surgeon,” Miss told him.  “I’ve said my preliminary piece.  I may have more to say after, but first, have your turn, it’ll help me know where you stand,” Musser said.  “I’d like more wine.”  Rook stood with a sweeping motion, stalked her way over, and picked up the red wine on the way.  She slammed the bottle down in front of him with enough force that Durocher’s glass of tea almost tipped over.  Durocher caught it.  “Thank you,” Musser said.  Lucy looked again at Verona.  She looked almost green.  Avery was rubbing her back.  Lucy put her hand at the back of Verona’s hair, fingers with hair between them, cupping the back of her friend’s head.  “Hey.”  “It’s okay.  Keep going,” Verona murmured.  Lucy dropped her hand.  Few things felt as bad as having something missing for most of your life, hurting because of it, and then getting it, only to face the idea of it being taken away.  Lucy had felt it with Wallace, and with friends.  She’d felt it more recently, working hard to feel strong and competent, only to face off against…  Against all of this.  The Wild Hunt.  Musser.  “Lucy?” Louise asked.  “If I remember right, you wanted to handle this part.”  Lucy nodded.  She’d wanted to handle a lot of it.  “It’s our job, right?  To be the representatives when practitioners come?  It came up at our awakening.”  “It is,” Miss answered.  Lucy nodded.  Okay.  “Kennet is now established as the premier market in the region,” she told Musser.  “Do you intend to claim it?”  “I do.  But let me interrupt you,” Musser said.  “Oh really?  Your lawyer there was talking about decorum, and you just said I could have a turn.”  “This spares us both hassle and annoyance.  As Headmaster of the Blue Heron, though it’s closed, I am privy to certain things related to it.  You’ve used the Atheneum Arrangement to get information on peddling.  The sale of cursed items for personal gain.”  Lucy glanced at Verona.  “Mrs. Graubard?” Musser asked.  Eliana Graubard nodded.  “We discussed what you might be doing.  We knew you were having people such as Raquel Musser sign contracts.  We found out you were working with Charles on the creation of the one Other, but we were already prepared to act if he moved against us.”  So they’d brought Hall to counter the contract, they’d brought Durocher as an answer to Charles, someone who could probably go toe to toe with the greater power of a region.  They’d brought Eliana Graubard to…?  Graubard met Verona’s eyes.  “Tell me it wasn’t your intention to peddle your town here, Kennet, at its would-be Lord.  A poison pill for him to swallow.  A cursed town.”  Lucy glanced sideways at Verona, eyebrow arched.  “If I don’t answer, I guess that says enough, huh?” Verona asked.  “Yes.”  “It crossed my mind.  I took some steps.  It wasn’t a primary plan.  Just something I dabbled in.”  “While I’m a specialist in dollmaking, I’m very good at handling cursed items and curses,” Graubard said.  “It won’t work.”  “Cool,” Verona replied.  “You know what’s neat about being a dabbler who jumps from one thing to the next?  Your enemy can’t anticipate you.  I didn’t actually go through with that.  If you came to deal with that, you wasted your trip.”  “I thought it was worth getting out of the way, regardless,” Musser said.  “Back to what I was saying, before your pointless interruption… you intend to claim Kennet,” Lucy said.  “Again, I do.”  “I have contracts with me,” Lucy said.  She got the contracts out of her bag, and stacked them on the table.  “May I?” Mr. Hall asked.  “No you may not.  It’s privileged information with each of the parties involved.  It’s part of the terms,” Lucy said.  “I may read excerpts or give summaries at my discretion, or allow people to read it if the groups in question are protected enough, but the only way Musser gets to read these in full is if he takes custody of them.”  “Custody being the key word,” Mr. Hall said.  He nodded, leaning back.  “Which is to say you’ve contrived to make it so that if Abraham Musser claims Kennet, then he-”  Lucy finished the sentence, “-takes on the responsibilities that come with Kennet.  Which include obligations to-”  Lucy held one contract, and pointed the sheaf of papers at Avery.  Avery sat up.  “-Nineteen markets, including ones related to Faerie, fairy, goblin, echo, and spirit world, fourteen lesser councils and groups you’ve overlooked, and roughly forty individuals ranging from craftsmen and Others with a mind for art or toolmaking, to booksellers and Aware with odds and ends to sell.  Some innocent stuff on the side.”  “It’s a lot,” Lucy said.  “It’s a lot for us, when we’ve got a bunch of varied Others with great skillsets, three practitioners, Aware, a mirror version of our town full of enterprising undercity denizens to work factories-”  She indicated the replacement foreman, Stew Mullen.  “Among other things I won’t get into.  And we’ve got Kennet found, another overlapping mirror version of our town know you’re acquainted with, lots of helpful Foundlings.”  “If you take Kennet, you’d better believe we’ll quit on you,” Verona said.  “We will strike, we’ll stop working, we’ll get in your way, we’ll make you fight for every last bit of it.”  “You’d better be prepared to have goblins of specific types,” Lucy said.  “Nightmares, and a whole lot of Lost and Founded stuff.  You’ll need resources, you’ll need information.  To do what the contracts outline.”  “Resources of the town come with the town,” Graubard said.  “We didn’t say they were with the town,” Avery said.  “And not all contracts come with the town either.  So if you take Kennet, if you’re intending to meet its obligations, you need to make sure you have certain things set up outside of Kennet first.”  “Means having to track down the right people who we dealt with, to make sure you have the things for sale or for refining goods,” Avery said.  “Which suggests I need to know what the contract terms are before I become obligated to follow the contract,” Musser replied.  “Which would mean expensive hiring of Augurs.  Chasing down threads in advance, chasing down things after.  Managing people.”  Time and work when you are stretched thin for both.  “Yeah,” Lucy replied, glaring at him.  “No.”  “No?” Avery asked.  “There are multiple ways this can fail.”  Miss said, “If you intend to try to establish a Lordship in Kennet without its active market, when we’ve made the market integral to its identity, tied into civilian business in Kennet above, Aware, Kennet below, Kennet found, and Kennet’s identity in other regions and with other groups… you hardly have a claim at all.”  Meaning that in the Lordship, you’d be potentially fighting blindfolded with a hand tied behind your back, Lucy thought.  If one side had more claim to something, then it changed the terms of any contest, making them more lopsided, to represent that claim.  “Don’t talk to me about claim,” Musser said.  “I don’t need any sort of lesson, nor do I need much of one.”  Did he seem just a bit irritated?  “We have bled for Kennet,” Lucy said.  “Fought, battled, suffered, drawn blood.  Killed.”  “I’m aware.”  “We sweated for Kennet,” Avery joined in.  “Worked our asses off, ran here and there, went from Blue Heron to here to Blue Heron again, I’ve gone back and forth from Thunder Bay.  These guys have built up industry with hard work, I’ve worked to connect people to Kennet.  That’s claim.  That gives us claim, absolutely.”  “I see what you’re doing.”  “Cried for Kennet, lost people for Kennet,” Verona said.  It looked like thoughts of the friends she’d made were heavy on her mind.  “Wrestled with personal demons for Kennet.  Blood, sweat, tears.”  “If you’re not taking the market, if you’re not willing to claim something that major?” Lucy asked.  “And you’re up against us, when we’ve got the claim that extends to three corners of our Selves?  We’re not going to make it easy.  We’re going to challenge you.”  “All of Kennet will reject you,” Louise said.  “We’ve talked about it.”  Toadswallow croaked, “If you care about majority rule, you’d better be prepared to go against everyone with a say in this town, everyone that’s come in to build something in our market.”  “I thought there was more room to discuss other things,” Musser said.  “Collaboration against the Dropped Call, as you’ve termed it.  But I see where things stand.  I’m not worried.  I’ll see you in a few weeks.”  He stood, glancing at his companions, who nodded and pushed their chairs back.  No.  No, Lucy knew just enough about claim and Law that she knew he didn’t want to be hammered like this.  He could make a claim and maybe with an arm tied behind his back and a blindfold on, he could still win, but anything they said would be a drop he didn’t want in the bucket.  Leaving meant that stopped.  “No,” Lucy said.  “If you walk away, you fucking coward, we’re going to say it every day until you come back.  That we reject you, that you have no claim, that you ran, that you’re a coward.  I will make it a fucking meme, I will get kids from my High School to say ‘fuck Musser’ because they want in on a secret project like the Arcade we used to have.  And they won’t know what it means but they’ll say it, and I know it’ll count against you.”  “Maybe it’ll even spread,” Verona said.  Musser, having stood, leaned over the table, one hand planted on the flat surface.  “You’re not the first to try to make their Lordship too complicated to seize.”  “We’re doing it fairly,” Lucy said.  “We want things this way.  So do others.  All these contracts, they’re invested in this.  That’s more claim.  This isn’t the kind of thing where you flip the table on us and say it’s unfair because we can’t handle the challenge we set up.  Because we are.”  “You insist on lecturing me about things my family is expert in.  I’m not worried.”  “I wonder,” Durocher murmured.  “Did you tell the people you were doing business with about the risks?”  “That sounds like a threat,” Avery said.  “From someone who said she’s neutral.”  “It’s a concern.  I’m not saying something Abraham hasn’t thought of, or anything you shouldn’t have thought about.  One way to handle a knot of a scenario like this is to cut through it.  Targeted removal of every party of the contract.”  “We told most,” Avery said.  “A couple weren’t communicative.  One person signed without reading any of it.  When you find them and confront the groups and people we’re working with, there’s an understanding they’ll stop working with us.  The idea is we pay them a fee even after they stop doing business with us.  It’s in your interest to leave them alone, turn them into penalties for us.”  Lucy wondered if he’d refute that.  She’d had her own worries he’d make an argument about maiming or killing them.  Screw the karma, screw the technical advantage in accepting surrender and leaving them be – he could threaten to terrorize them, knowing that the rippling waves of fear of being part of their deal would scare people off.  But he wasn’t saying or doing anything like that.  “It still takes time,” Lucy said.  “Finding them.  Even with Augurs, with Chase in your back pocket.  Time you don’t have.”  “Effort,” Verona added.  “Not always easy, not everyone is going to back down.  I don’t think you’ll be able to disentangle yourself from everything.  People who aren’t in the loop will assume Kennet is holding to current responsibilities and stuff.  Those assumptions have power.”  “Travel,” Avery said.  “While you’re tackling all that, you’re having to go back and forth.  Dealing with Lords.  Charles’ traps.  And don’t forget, we can still find more while you’re dealing with others.”  “Still complicated,” Lucy said, cutting back on the swears because her mom was watching.  “Come on.  You want to make a play?  Either tell us, let’s hash it out, or admit you don’t have a play, and we’ll be calling you out and fighting your claim in the meantime.”  Musser straightened, cracking his knuckles.  Then he turned to Mr. Hall.  “There’s precedent.  Others have tried similar things.  It doesn’t work.”  “There is.  It traces back to what we were talking about, rule of discourse.  Establishment with the public, establishment from the public.  In Canada’s national government, a government in power can’t make binding deals the next party to be in charge is forced to uphold.  Essentially.  It defeats the purpose.”  “The Seal has its weight.  It can’t be denied,” Musser said, turning toward the table, looking across it, from Miss and Rook to Matthew and Louise, to the parents, and then to Lucy and her friends.  “Nothing to do with government, Lords, or any of that.  It’s partnership,” Lucy told him.  “The contract herein is intended to wed the organized markets of Kennet above, Kennet below, and Kennet found, hereafter referred to as Kennet, to the organized practitioner enclave of the- let’s redact that.  In case you’re violent and try cutting through what we built here.  Wed.  And on page… sixteen, if you want out or are forced out of Kennet, represented by its leadership, you must divorce yourself of the partnership, paying penalties and making restitution based on your total net worth.”  Hall snorted a short laugh.  “Who wrote that?”  Lucy didn’t respond.  “I know most.”  Lucy was silent.  Hall turned to Musser.  “Well?” Musser asked.  “I’d have to see the contract.”  “Then get your hands on it.”  Clark Hall turned to them.  He paused, then said, “Earlier, I said you could challenge me.  Call me on what you seemed to think was a bluff or falsehood.  There are provisions, deals we can make, elements of practice-based Law that allow for word to be examined.  Especially for contracts and oaths.”  “And?” Lucy asked.  “I call on those provisions.  The arbiter’s proviso-”  “Which requires you to be neutral,” Verona said.  “I read up on that.”  “More neutral than Durocher is apparently being,” Lucy added.  “-interrogated word, receipts of affirmation, the arbiter’s testimony, nineteen ninety three-”  “Sounds like gibberish to me,” Matthew said.  “Are you trying to sound clever?”  “There is substance to each of these assertions.  I’ll cut straight to the point.  I could twist your arms and force you to let me see, but that takes time, it’s a hassle, it costs both of us.  I can swear an oath of secrecy, I won’t speak of the contract details.  I’ll simply verify if it does what you say it does.  I’ll look at three random ones, if you can attest to the fact there’s no major traps in the remainder.”  “Why would we attest to that?” Lucy asked.  “The whole point is if you want to try to claim this place we bled, sweated, and shed tears for… you gotta work for it.”  “Because you’re repeating that, I’ll answer it,” Musser said. “I state my own claim.  On three points of Self, I’ve staked my own claim.  One I would argue is superior.”  “I actually want to hear this,” Toadswallow spoke up.  “Me too,” Lucy said.  “Fine.  I’ve bled for Kennet, in my fight to claim it.  I’ve bled here against Witch Hunter, as prospective Lord, and in fighting your Dogs.  Drops of blood, but they’re drops more than I’ve shed elsewhere, and more blood has been shed as a casualty of my coming here.”  “But have you nearly died for Kennet?” Lucy asked.  “I’ve come closer here than I have in most places.  Which wasn’t close at all, but the prerequisites for points of Self can’t be too high, or people would be denied any right to Self at all.”  Musser turned toward Rook.  “Say I’m wrong to claim it.”  “Why must I say anything?”  “Because you’ve concerned yourself with process, you’re apparently the host.  Tell me I’m in the wrong to claim blood of my Self.”  “No.”  “I’ve sweated for Kennet.  I’ve labored, the very fact I’m here.  I’ve made alliances, given breath, wiped sweat off my brow, in the comings and goings, in warm weather and cold.  Prior to my claim of it, I worked to take most of Ontario.  An act I don’t think you can come close to matching.”  “That was against Kennet,” Avery said.  “You may not agree with the nature of the work I was doing, but I wasn’t in the wrong nor was my sweat devalued by it.  It has merit.”  He didn’t ask Rook for that one. Maybe he figured answering Avery was enough to nail it in.  “Did you cry?” Verona asked.  “Because honestly, I wouldn’t blame you, what you lost, but I kinda just want to hear it.”  “Sex,” Musser said.  Verona blinked, before turning to Lucy.  “What.”  “Blood, sweat, and sex.”  “Do tell, Mr. Musser,” Toadswallow leaned in.  “What of Kennet did you fuck?  Who did you give your seed to?”  “I gave my seed to Kennet,” Musser answered.  “I issued it forth, it gestated, and it grew up into a young man, borne of my seed.  At my urging, he was brought to Kennet.”  “You’re actually using the fact you sent your son to his death?” Lucy asked.  “He was my seed, raised as my son, and on Kennet’s foundation, he was spilt and spent.  Blood, sweat, sex.  I answer your claim of Self with my own.”  Clark touched Musser’s shoulder.  He wasn’t as tall as Musser, so Musser had to bend down for them to exchange whispers.  “I can offer to stand down, for a look at the contract.  You can use another member of my circle.  You lose the benefit of my advice, but the others are nearly as good.”  Musser nodded.  Mr. Hall looked at Lucy.  “Let me see the contract-”  “And you stand down?  You swear to silence?”  “Until all relevant matters are done, I won’t speak of the details without permission.  I’d appreciate some grace from you, if we get further along and establish a neutral relationship, but I won’t expect it.  My silence, except to verify and report on how much of the contract can be argued, I state its validity, and I remove myself from this situation.”  And if it’s not valid, if you can find a way through, then what do we even have?  This at least made Musser work for it.  He’d have to find someone else after this.  Lucy looked at her friends, then at Miss and Rook, then Louise and Matthew.  Her eyes passed over her mom.  She nodded.  “Say it.”  “So sworn.  Silence, but for the exceptions stipulated here, and I remove myself from this situation, not speaking of this, nor working to help Abraham Musser against you in the future.”  Lucy nodded, then motioned.  Mr Hall walked around the table to their side of the one end of it.  He ran a finger through the stack of contracts, then split it, and took the top one, pulling a felt-tip pen out of his pocket, the tip and cap a dull, rusty orange-red.  He circled the occasional word as he skimmed, the pen poised over the lines he was reading.  The marks were quick.  The first paragraph past the summary, he drew four diagonal lines through- an X, but with a space for a word.  He wrote ‘invalid’.  The next paragraph, he crossed out a key line.  He wrote ‘no’.  He scribbled out a quotation.  Another paragraph with an ‘x’, ‘invalid’.  One circled.  Lucy watched as he went through it with an expert hand.  Like a man cleaning the hundredth fish he’d ever cleaned, working easily to separate this from that, to identify the vitals.  It was almost like he didn’t need to read it to identify the weak points.  To kill it, piece my piece.  Invalid.  Invalid.  No.  Questionable- can argue down.  A paragraph with ‘weak’ written over top of it in red felt.  Another invalid.  A circled paragraph with a question mark.  A paragraph with a down arrow drawn over the words at the right hand side, a note- ‘can argue down, becomes negligible’.  He went back a couple of pages, crossed one he’d circled out.  ‘No merit’.  He got to the end, reread it, scribbling out two more sections along the way.  “I’d like to look at two more.  Three in total.”  “What do we gain if we allow that?” Verona asked.  “Clarity?”  “Just say it,” Lucy told him.  Her blood was throbbing through her in time with the heartbeat, and it reminded her body it was injured.  The stitches throbbed.  Mr. Hall turned toward Musser.  “There are parts that can be removed or argued away.  A better lawyer than the one who wrote this can cancel this, eliminate this, let you ignore all of this.”  Lucy thought she might faint.  All that buildup, all that preparation.  For nothing.  Fodder for an expert, expensive contract lawyer to come through and annihilate in minutes.  Weeks of daily work, time she could’ve been with friends, boyfriend, or working on practice stuff, to handle this another way.  Then she saw his finger.  He was pointing at sections.  “Overall?”  Musser asked.  “It’s window dressing.  The stuff I cut away, the stuff you’d argue down, it’s extras, unimportant.”  “Things I’d have to work through, individually.  Different for each contract?”  “I’m not allowed to answer that.  The bones of it, the heart, it’s there.  You either accept Kennet with its responsibilities to each partner, or you disclaim what I’m guessing is every contract.  You can try to take Kennet without any of the contracts, but with virtually no claim at all.  Meanwhile-”  “We get a ton, right?” Lucy asked.  “Because we took on that responsibility.  It’s ours.  It’s part of our claim.”  “I can’t elaborate or agree too much.”  If Musser wanted, he could reduce that claim.  Shrink the stack of contracts by eliminating key people.  But what did that even get him in the long run?  Ontario without many of its markets?  An aftermath of messy Lordships?  “If I put a pawn in place here?  To hold the Lordship?”  Lucy answered, because Clark Hall couldn’t.  “Goes back to the ‘partnership’ and ‘divorce’ thing.  If you put a pawn into place to handle things and get this in order, they’re in the partnership.  It’s between them and their partner.  They can’t be your subordinate while they’re doing those things.  And if you put someone in place as Lord and they then vacate the seat to give it to you… they have to go through the steps in the contract for the divorcing part.”  Same for you, Lucy thought.  He seemed deep in thought.  “Then burn.”  “What?” Lucy asked.  “You’ve set up relationships to markets.  Relationships predicated on two things.  That there be an outside market, yes, you’ve explained why it would be a problem to try to track them down, answer each individually, and handle it while you’re trying to match me in speed, recruiting one for every one I remove.  But it’s also based on there being a Kennet market here.  There is no need to hunt for it, no need to hold back.  So expect my visit.  Expect ruin, expect less gentleness than I’ve shown so far.  I’ve stated my intentions, there’s no reason to denounce my claim.  In the meantime, I’ll handle those who betrayed me to assist you and the Carmine by proxy.”  Lucy glanced at Durocher.  Do you see?  Do you care?  He wanted to hurt your students.  Now he’s threatening to burn our market to the ground.  Durocher didn’t say anything, but looked thoughtful.  “Expect me,” Musser said, turning to go.  “Thank you for the hospitality.  Mr. Hall, I know you can’t speak of anything or cooperate, but let me drive you home, and protect you on the way.  No obligations or expectations.”  He walked down the fire escape, followed by the three practitioners.  “That’s it?” Lucy asked.  “We cornered him, made Kennet too unappetizing, and…?”  “He’ll burn it down, rule over the ashes,” Matthew said.  “All he really needs is the territory.”  “A man like Musser, left with no good way to get what he wants, will not give up what he wanted,” Rook intoned.  “He will give up ‘good’.”  “And the guillotine over our heads remains?” Avery asked.  Lucy tensed.  Her hands were clenched and she worried she’d popped a stitch in her arm, because it felt bad, and maybe wet.  Maybe that was sweat, or her mind playing tricks on her.  “Bull,” Lucy said.  “No, there’s- this sucks too much.  There’s too much bullshit.  This is really how the world works?  He’s powerful, so he gets away with everything?  His fancy lawyer gets to rewrite events?  He gets away free?  He hurts people we care about?”  “Too often, you’re right, that’s how the world works,” Rook replied.  “I’ve been down this road many a time.  You learn to compromise more, to soften the blow.”  Lucy looked at her mom.  There was a degree of bewilderment, but she supposed that was fair.  That had been confusing, and convoluted, and her mom had missed the lead-in, because of work.  “What if we call the bluff?” Lucy asked.  “If we’re facing the risk we lose everything… if there’s thirty days left, we get a Christmas and most of a peak ski season with Kennet, then lose Kennet altogether… why not?”  “Because as much as this was a valiant project,” Rook said, “many of us can leave.  Miss and Kennet found can be put out of reach.  He can take the Lordship and unseat the Carmine and if we seal things enough, we can keep him from taking Kennet found.  We have full existences ahead of us.  More to do.  We will try again.”  “What if we don’t accept that?  What if we want this to be the try that counts?” Lucy asked.  “It did,” Miss replied.  “Even if it was a loss, it was a fine effort.  There may be a chance you can fight him.”  “With the Wild Hunt dogging us?” Lucy asked.  “For another month?  Can we get that far?  He came here because he needs a win and a win against Charles here will do a lot to weaken him, right?  Well… we need a fucking win too.”  “I suggest a vote,” Louise said.  “Fast?” Lucy asked.  “We need to do something.”  “Friends,” Verona said.  She looked at Avery.  “McCauleigh.  Other allies.”  The vote was called. There were parts of the vote she didn’t care much about.  She respected the leaders of Kennet below but if they voted on Lucy’s behalf or wanted to fight Musser when he attacked next month, it didn’t really matter.  But Connor and her mom didn’t raise their hands.  Lucy cared about that.  That mattered.  “That’s enough, I think,” Louise said, making a tally in her notebook.  “An agreement.  No, to the question of whether to let Musser go unanswered and flee Kennet.”  “We’re doing this?” Lucy asked, to be sure.  She smiled a bit at her mom.  She was pretty sure her mom got it, now.  What they were up against.  She didn’t ‘get’ practice, and she had grudges against some of the people here, but the dangers… their parents had all come around.  Where applicable.  “Alabaster,” Lucy said.  “I call on you.”  “Sable,” Avery said.  “You’ll do too.”  “Aurum,” Verona added.  “Any of you three, or all three.  Let’s leave the Carmine out of this?”  The light at the glass of the greenhouse-like encasement over Rook’s movable rooftop garden distorted further.  White light, golden light, and shadow intensified.  Glass broke.  Blood oozed from cracks.  All four Judges were present, now.  “Didn’t invite you,” Lucy told Charles.  “As if I’d miss it,” Charles replied, a fierce look in his eyes.  He had a Durocher-like energy, restless.  “Don’t worry.  I won’t say or do anything my fellow judges aren’t willing to say or do.  Make your statement.”  “I, Lucy Ellingson, challenge Musser.”  “I, Verona Hayward, second the motion.  We challenge him on-”  “On all that he is,” Lucy added.  “The points we made, the challenges, we called him out?  We made ourselves stand out and made ourselves something good, here, helping people.  We denied him what he wants.  He shouldn’t get to pull this shit.”  “No way he runs,” Avery said.  She glanced over the rooftop of Kennet’s Others and Aware, some of whom had risen from their seats.  “No way he leaves this hanging over our heads a third time, making threats for the future.”  “I don’t buy that he’s a leader,” Lucy added.  “I don’t buy he’s legit, either.  Not like he’s a self-made man.  So let’s make that challenge, test us, test him.”  “Granted,” Charles answered the statement, and he did it with a mean smile that Lucy didn’t trust at all.

      "               <Document: {'content': \"       Fourth Point of Order  Avery could have kicked herself.  A few times, in fact.  Missing the whole deal with the bringer of titillating dreams, it meant she wasn’t quite on the same page with the others.  They’d sorted out the Law stuff, and she felt a bit useless here.  The whole idea with her leaving was that she’d be out there, helping, but also paying attention, contributing.  This was her not catching something that should’ve been obvious, with consequences.  And then the whole Path deal.  She wasn’t sure if the Paths were kind of kicking her ass lately because she was off her game or because she’d slipped up and let Sheridan see her on camera and there was backlash from Sheridan and Rowan being made Aware, but it really sucked.  Doing the high-five-into-hand-hold with Verona, not treating this seriously.  It had been Avery reaching out, doing something that, if she thought about it for five seconds, was something only Julette and her would get, and that was Verona, not Julette.  Either way, not paying attention enough because she was off her game, or not paying attention with protecting her family and more consequences and pain in the ass stuff as a result.  Snowdrop came up to her, and Avery leaned onto the incoming head-bonk, as Snowdrop banged forehead into Avery’s shoulder, before hugging Avery from the side.  Good familiar, Avery thought.  She didn’t want to compare Snowdrop to a dog, but like… that was the kind of emotional backup she figured dogs were best at.  She made herself pay more careful attention.  “Next point of order?” the regional spirit asked.  Lucy stepped forward.  So did one of the Alabaster’s people, a boy at least four years younger than Avery or Lucy.  Maybe five or six years younger.  He had long-ish hair, and very serious eyes.  “Really?” Lucy asked.  The boy looked back over his shoulder at the Alabaster, then looked at Lucy and nodded.  “For our fourth point of order, she’s calcified,” Lucy said.  “Explain,” the regional spirit said.  “I have to get into some side stuff to explain just what we believe has gone wrong.  With your permission?”  The spirit nodded.  “The Alabaster as a role and the Alabaster as a throne have certain things in their area of responsibility.  We’ve brought up a few duties about care and upkeep, but they also stand in for incarnations, when there isn’t a dominant one to manage things in the area.  So if there’s a wrinkle in the cycle of the natural order, the Alabaster may step in.  If there’s a wrinkle in the process of death and dying, some Other mucking with things on a big scale, and there’s no Death, no grim reaper, sorting it all out, then higher powers like her are tasked with managing that.  That’s tied into what they get as far as power goes.”  They’d had a whole talk about the Alabaster and parallels.  “Incarnations of major, inviolable concepts run into an issue where they calcify.  They get so set in their ways and routines, they start missing wrinkles and issues.  They become mechanical, they stop handling things they should handle.  They slow down.  They work less.  So… that’s when they reach out, they find a vessel, absorb a person.  That person gets a lot of freedom to interpret their duties, maybe fix a problem in their old life.  A soldier becomes the new War, gets to spend a good chunk of the power they’re given to save their hometown as part of the deal for assuming a huge responsibility, maybe gets to emphasize certain duties over others, then settles into the role for a good few decades, maybe a century or two, before they start calcifying too.”  Avery didn’t want to look over her shoulder at Guilherme, who had their backs here, but she couldn’t help but think about him becoming a member of the Winter court.  “The reason I brought that up is that it’s happening here,” Lucy said.  “She’s been Alabaster for a ridiculously long time – since before Canada was colonized?”  “Yes,” the child Lucy was arguing with said.  “Since before anyone came.”  “As a standalone creature, that’s one thing, that’s fine, but as a force with this much input over people, our practice, Others?  When she can apparently take the power she’s meant to use to stabilize, and instead use it to help the Carmine de-stabilize?  Take what’s meant to heal-”  The regional spirit looked away as she drank her coffee.  Bored? Avery thought.  “-and ruin?  That’s huge.  It’s playing into all of the other issues.  She has various things in her scope of things she covers, and I can- I would break down how each is calcified, but I want to respect your time.”  Respecting the spirit’s time wasn’t part of the plan.  They’d hoped to nail the Alabaster on a lack of mercy, healing, shelter, and other things.  “Pick one,” the regional spirit said.  “We will move on to others if I can’t come to a clear verdict here.”  Lucy paused, eyebrows drawing together.  “The Alabaster is meant to have sacrifice as a big part of what she covers in her duties, in a very different way than the Carmine does.  But in her calcification, in how careful she’s being about not being drained, in being all about sacrifice when, as far as we’ve been able to run down, it looks like it’s been decades or centuries since she really truly spent anything worth spending.  How can you arbitrate sacrifice when you don’t sacrifice anything?  Except, I guess, the people who came to her for help?  They’re on the chopping block, apparently.”  Lucy indicated the little boy in front of her.  “A shake-up is needed, if only to have better eyes on really important things,” Lucy finished.  “Response?”  “I’m not sure I understood all that, but I think it’s weird to say she’s- what’s the word?”  “Calcified.  Stuck, hardened,” the regional spirit replied.  “Stuck.  When you’re also saying she’s doing something new, by working with the Carmine Exile.”  Lucy replied, “Her being stuck is why she’s working with the Carmine Exile, and are you admitting-”  “Let him finish.”  Lucy sighed.  “On the point of sacrifice?” the regional spirit asked.  “Uhh.  I think her existence is a sacrifice.  She does what she does and it’s all she really does.  She looks after us.  She saved us.  She helps others.”  Lucy looked a little frustrated.  “And the calcification?” the regional spirit asked.  “Getting stuck?” the kid asked.  “I don’t see why it matters.  Isn’t it better to have someone who knows how to do the job?”  Lucy raised a hand.  “Let me look into this first.  I’ll get back to you, either to move to the next point or hear your argument.”  Lucy nodded, retreating to where Verona and Avery stood, while the Alabaster gave the spirit access to the necessary elements.  “You seem bothered,” Avery said.  “I don’t like that a lot of the evidence is happening with the Alabaster showing it.  How do we know how that evidence is being edited?  What clips are being shown?  Is it a full picture?  A biased one?”  “Lucy the movie buff,” Verona murmured.  “Feels kind of ridiculous I can make an argument, and she sends out this cute little kid in a toga to be all herp derp, I don’t understand, I’m so adorable, but the ancient arbiter of justice is really trying, you guys, basically.”  “Guilherme?” Avery asked.  “Avery Kelly,” he replied.  He’d barely budged since settling into a sitting position.  “Are we doing okay?” Avery asked.  “As someone I’ve given gifts and lessons to, I’d hope you’d be able to say whether or not you’re doing alright without my input.”  “Technically, I haven’t really been around for lessons,” Avery said.  “But you’ve been around, and I would hope you take away lessons from any interaction.”  “Does that mean if Cherrypop showed up, you’d count her as a student too?” Verona asked.  “Guys, just roll with it,” Lucy said.  “I would question Cherrypop’s ability to learn a given lesson,” Guilherme said.  “No, I taught things to each of you, and each of you were taught things relevant to this conversation.  I hope you’d be able to take from those lessons to better understand this situation.”  “If I say we’re doing badly, and I’m wrong, then that’s going to gainsay me,” Avery said.  “If you say you’re doing well and you’re right, then you succeed, and garner an advantage.”  “Does that mean we’re doing well?” Verona asked.  Guilherme shifted position, looking like he was going to sigh, but it was a prelude to a sigh without the actual sigh itself.  Like Verona’s statement wasn’t even worth the emotional reaction.  “Is she being manipulative?  Sending the kid out?” Lucy asked.  Guilherme gave her a look, like ‘what did I just say?’  “She is.”  “Yes,” Guilherme confirmed.  “Now that you know that, what do you also know?”  “I don’t know how she prepped them that well,” Lucy replied.  “Answer my question,” Guilherme said.  “A manipulation is a weakness.”  “That doesn’t sound like something a Fae would say,” Verona remarked.  “Turn it around.  If you can’t identify it as a manipulation, you can’t identify it as a weakness.”  “So really, it’s bad manipulations are weaknesses?”  “Or feints, or distractions,” Lucy said.  “Which may be the ideal time for a goblin fart bomb.”  “You’re better than that,” Guilherme told her.  “Oh I know,” Lucy replied.  “I’ve got some Dog of War stuff too, and shamanism, some magic items.”  Guilherme did that not-a-sigh sigh thing again.  The Alabaster was still giving the regional spirit all of the info.  “Feels cheap, that she uses a cute kid to undercut my argument, still.”  “Any way to get back at her for that?” Avery asked.  “Turn the manipulation into a weakness?”  “That is the question to be asking,” Guilherme said.  Felt good, getting that backup, when she was feeling a bit punk.  “Yeah.  I think so.  I don’t want to say in case the Alabaster’s listening.”  Avery looked.  The Alabaster didn’t turn her head or glance at them, where it felt like Charles might, in a similar situation.  But he’d been human half a year ago.  Avery wasn’t sure the Alabaster had ever been human.  “Big question for me is how are these people that well informed?” Verona asked.  “Feels like they’re mouthpieces.  Did she figure out what we’re going to say?”  “You give away a great deal,” Guilherme said.  “And she is old and has spent much of her existence watching people.”  Avery looked at the Alabaster, and, fuzzing her eyes a bit, it sure felt like she could imagine the Wolf standing there instead.  Old.  With uncanny knowledge about Avery, about her friends, her life.  She wasn’t sure why the Wolf was haunting her like this, so recently.  It was like… being at home or near home, she felt grounded, real life and things she knew just in arm’s reach.  But on the Paths, things were exciting, interesting, and full of potential, chances to grow, chances to meet people, chances to gain power.  This felt like the worst of both worlds.  Being kind of mired, but not close to home either.  Very little was familiar.  The light shining into the regional spirit’s eyes faded.  People shifted position, looking.  Lucy stepped away from their group, approaching the middle of the clearing.  “Your arguments, Lucy?” the spirit asked.  Does that mean what you saw wasn’t decisive? Avery wondered.    It was too easy to read too much into every little detail.  “About the sacrifice point.  I don’t buy it.  She’s not doing anything that others aren’t doing.  Hell, Alpeana, the nightmare who resides in Kennet when she’s not working?  She has just as much responsibility, if not more, she gets less for it.  When I talk about the Alabaster and sacrifice, I’m talking about something core to Alabasters, not things that are common to all judges.  It’d be like if the Sable shirked all his responsibilities about death, or passages.”  “Can you name an instance where her duties were shirked?”  “I can name three.  I could get more if you gave me time.”  “Name one.”  “Ave?” Lucy asked.  Avery cleared her throat, standing a little taller.  “The sacrificial goat.  Not only was it turned against people by a Judge meant to act as a background, backup role unless specifically called on by his duties, he had the initiative to create things like it because she was giving him power, and then its use was permitted by the Alabaster, who had duties to handle that sort of thing, that could get out of control or have collateral damage.”  “This isn’t just a metaphorical firefighter giving gas to the arsonist.  This is the firefighter giving gas to the arsonist and then not doing her fucking job at handling the fire,” Lucy said.  “Response?” the spirit asked.  The kid looked up, frowned, then said, “Was there a fire?  With this goat?”  Avery gave the reply, saying, “A council of practitioners is playing a not-fun game of hot potato with the goat, trying not to let it be accidentally sacrificed.  The burden was placed on Thunder Bay.”  “So there’s been no fire for her to put out?” the boy asked.  Lucy was the one to reply, and she sounded a bit angry as she said, “There’s more to being a firefighter than putting out the fires.  Something something prevention worth more than a cure.  It’s irresponsible to put the entirety of the work on a council prone to infighting, where one greedy person deciding to use the goat could cause catastrophic damage.”  Lucy was probably annoyed at having to debate with a kid.  “But there’s no fire, it’s handled?”  “There’s no fire, I’d hesitate to call it handled.”  “How long has it been there, without any issues?”  “Too long,” Lucy replied.  She turned to look at the Alabaster and the regional spirit.  “She hasn’t handled it.  What she’s doing, letting Charles do what he wants, playing it safe, saving up power, not spending anything, not sacrificing, not doing anything more than the bare minimum, that’s what she’s calcified into.  And disasters are happening.  The region is suffering.”  “One of the very first things we learned about practice,” Avery muttered.  “What’s that?” the regional spirit asked.  Avery looked up.  She drew in a deep breath.  “It’s one of the first things we learned about practice.  When our diagram for the awakening ritual was being drawn, it was explained to us.  That there has to be balance.  If you have…”  She swung her bag around to get inside it, pulling out the first notebook she got her hands on.  She called for Snowdrop with a feeling sent across the familiar bond, and Snowdrop trotted over, interested.  Avery put the book on top of Snowdrop’s head.  Snowdrop signaled amusement.  Balancing it there, Avery pressed down on one corner, tilting it.  “There has to be more balance than this.  And there’s not.”  “But,” the little boy said.  “We’re all still here, aren’t we?  There’s no fire.”  “Let’s move on,” the regional spirit said.  “Next point.”  Avery frowned, composed herself, and stepped forward.  An old woman stepped out of the crowd.  With very long hair partially tied back, and a dress made with linen fabric knotted at the shoulders, she looked a bit like a hippie.  “Avery,” Lucy said.  “What?” Avery asked, turning around, looking.  “Swap with Verona?”  Avery glanced at Verona, who made a face, lips turned down at the edges, tongue sticking out a bit, clearly not happy to be doing this out of turn.  Avery reversed direction, walking back.  Verona stepped forward.  The old woman hesitated, looking back, and a teenage boy with a flower crown stepped out of the crowd, looking equally disconcerted, like he wasn’t sure.  And there it is, Avery thought.  Like Guilherme had suggested.  This wasn’t random.  The little boy had been sent out at that specific time for specific reasons.  Avery gripped the strap of her bag in one hand, finger on the blurry city magic pin.  It wasn’t any use here, but she liked reminding herself she had it, that she’d worked with city magic more than either of the others.  Even Verona, who’d liked using it for shortcuts before Lis had taken over Kennet and sort of blocked that use.  She looked at the regional spirit, who gave very little away, but who was watching.  She’s the judge, the jury.  She’s watching, and now she knows, she has reason to wonder.  What’s the manipulation?  Why these people, at this time?  And Avery was left to wonder too.  The Alabaster didn’t look especially worried, even with this unprecedented -Avery was pretty sure it was unprecedented- challenge against her.  What’s your game?  Avery thought.  🟂  “Aha, here you are.”  “Was I hard to find?”  “There’s a restaurant with a similar name-”  “Further down the block.  Of course.  I’m sorry.  I should have realized and told you it was the bar, here-  tavern, actually, I’ve been told, it’s important to be clear.”  “I see.”  “Let me pay for your drink.  Nothing romantic intended, mind you- I have a fiancé.”  “Of course.  And I am married.  Still, it’s appreciated.  Thank you, Ms. Behaim.”  “I don’t think we’ve had the occasion to talk much outside of the council, have we?”  “Not since you began.”  “It feels so strange to be using names.”  “Speaking of strange, I’ve noticed we don’t have neighbors at the nearby tables- Ah.  That’s some good diagram work.”  “With an exclusion for our bartender, so let’s keep an eye out for him.  Shall we get to it?  I’m going to order a bite while I’m getting a beer, my fiancé was working late.  I didn’t eat yet.”  “Just the drink for me.  Shall we wave our man down?  There we are.  Hello.  A gin St. Clements.”  “Hill street ale, and one number four cheeseburger, add Canadian bacon.  Sweet potato fries for the side.”  “Sure thing, Ms. Behaim.  Ma’am.”  “They know you here, it seems.”  “Being too well known at a place like this.  Damning, isn’t it?”  “Hmm, I wouldn’t say it’s, ehem, damning, if it’s the right sort of place.  At least it’s not first names.”  “I should watch my language, shouldn’t I?  Hm.  Sorry.”  “Mmm.”  “So, shall we get to it?”  “How far have you come, digging into the situation, Ms. Behaim?”  “Musser is out, he can’t get the foothold he once did.  He’s a broken man.  There is very little standing in that Carmine’s way.  Mass exodus of practitioners, even Others are moving out or, if violent enough and willing to bow to the Lords and the Judges they’ve put on top, they’re settling in.  It’s next to impossible to pass through without first agreeing to accept the Carmine rule.  I’ve even got one report from a practitioner on a flight from Ottawa to Edmonton that they ran into plane trouble while flying over.”  “Of the practice or Other variety?”  “Other.  They had to practice to change the pilot’s mind and keep him from diverting to a landing in the Carmine territory.”  “We should let the practitioners of Ottawa know.”  “I already asked Mr. Hardeep to message anyone who’d notified us about travel plans, to let them know, so they can adjust.”  “Keeping the poor man busy.  He’ll earn his spot on the council, I’m sure.  Shit.  Territory practitioners cannot enter or cross, is it?  That paints a grim and inconvenient picture.”  “If it’s not one already, it’s becoming one.  But, while we’re talking about inconvenience, I was just checking before you came.  I thought you’d be amused… slide that candle closer for me?”  “Hm?  Sure.”  “This wire is sister to one in a clock I store my reserve of power in.  Lighting this, it, here… there.  See?  With the flame?”  “Something’s pulling on your power, still.”  “My little contribution toward the summoning we helped with.  Not much, but enough I can keep tabs on it.  Our little acorn brained spirit is carrying on, doing what he does, even after half a day.  It’s petty, but it puts a smile on my face.  Yours too, it seems.”  “It feels more like what I thought practice would be when I was little.”  “I don’t think I ever had any such illusions, sadly.  I’ve got notes on various key players, my private investigators are keeping tabs on some.  Private investigators who are good at getting past the sorts of anti-detection measures practitioners use.”  “Like your little diagram there, with the salt on the counter.”  “Like that, yes.”  “Witch Hunters?”  “Through old family contacts.”  “Good investigators to have, if they can handle themselves if things go bad.”  “They’ll be placed to act if need be.  Either way, here’s your copy of the documents.  I’ve got the rest for the rest of the council tomorrow.”  “Still warm from the print shop.  Down the street?  Passed it while looking for you.”  “One and the same.  If you want to read it over now, I can try to answer questions.  Just forgive me if I’m eating my burger while you’re asking.  Oh, here it comes now.  I think I’m predictable, they might’ve started it as soon as they saw me come in.”  “I’ll do that.”  “Your augurs.  Are they Belanger?  From the magic school?”  “Enclave.  A business.  They find and hire good augurs from elsewhere.  I thought it was better to get an outside look in.”  “And here I am, asking contacts in the thick of it.  Good.  Different approaches.”  “You’ve referenced augurs in the past.  Where are yours?”  “Chronomancy, working with time, augury, looking to the future.  We’ve interacted with all sorts, comparing notes.  Behaims do some work with the Belangers, but nothing intimate.  I think my uncle, family head, was upset they refused to have our children attend their magic school, me included- I was a child once.”  “Were you now?”  “Heh.  So, either way, he worked with others when possible.”  “Hmm.  Yes.”  “They refused us.  For much the same reason I think you were wary about a Behaim on your council.”  “Yet you’ve proven yourself.  We watched you more closely than we do most, and we watch everyone very closely, as you know.”  “Mm, mmm.”  “This is good work, with research.”  “You’ve done your own.”  “I have.”  “Mmm.”  “Mmm.”  “You’re reluctant to say.  What is it you don’t want to tell me, even as I nudge and hint about your sources?”  “I was talking to the augur enclave as I walked into the restaurant, I hoped to have them on the phone for when I talked to you, to share.  Now I’m…”  “It’s bad?”  “It’s… comprehensive.  I’ve been mulling it over, trying to figure out what can be done about it.”  “Share what you know?  Let’s talk it out.”  “In Guelph, there is a new church.  The building is red, to residents it’s as if it was always there.  The Church of Bloody Glory in Onward Willow.  Directly tied and rooted in an undercity in Guelph.  A spatial knotting.”  “The Carmine’s pet blood goddess.  We were wondering earlier this week what she was doing.  This, then.”  “Twelve similar Churches of the Bloody Glory in Toronto.  One in Peterborough.  Three in London, Ontario.”  “How many total?”  “We don’t know.  There are signs of knottings and churches manifesting in every population center over five hundred people.  In the cities, either three or seven.  Twelve in Toronto.”  “With associating knottings?”  “Undercities, specifically.  Different types.  The churches are crossover points.  Denizens of the undercity will go to church for services, a scattered few will filter out into the city or town above.  But there’s a larger group, more cohesive, that leaves later.  The augurs think- unverified, we can’t get a good look or listen in, yet, after services, people stay and get orders.  They’re organizing.”  “And the Carmine now has an army.”  “The worst sort.  No rank and file to mow down.  Any house, any road, any patch of wilderness, it could have irregular forces each with their own tactics, resources, and independent command structures.”  “Are the knots stable?”  “You do know your stuff, Ms. Behaim.  No.  And they’re fresh.  Both the knotted people and the locations, they haven’t hardened into metaphorical Gordian knots.”  “Do they connect to one another?”  “Who knows?  The augurs don’t.  I was thinking…”  “The witch hunters.”  “Many could pass for a denizen.  Can you get them into the Churches of Bloody Glory?”  “And from there, into the undercities, to investigate?  I’ll ask my witch hunter contacts.  They’re backed by the divine?”  “Maricica, naked and glorious and forever soaked in blood.  Cells could have people with some divine power.”  “And-or something Abyssal, am I right?  Abyssal power, contacts pulled up from the Abyss?  She’s still rooted down there?”  “Yes.”  “I hate to ask, but…”  “No.  Your hometown is safe and secure, Ms. Behaim.  So far.”  “Mm.”  “Where do we even begin?  With the Lords serving the Carmine, it was one thing, already next to impenetrable.  But now this?  Mockery, inversion, and bastardization of the Judge role, of Lords, and now the Innocent population?”  “He wants to turn a mirror on us.  The question isn’t where we begin, but where he stops.  He already expanded once.”  “The augurs think it was pre-emptive.  To catch our three guests from this afternoon as they made a move.  Had the attack succeeded with us, they could’ve arrived in Ottawa only to find themselves firmly in his clutches.”  “Does that mean he’s not interested in expansion for expansion’s sake?”  “The augurs don’t think so.  At least not in the clearly foreseeable future, not expansion for expansion’s sake.  I was thinking- don’t take what I tell you and present it to the council.  I’ve got to make a good showing after having nothing to present today.”  “Of course.  I’m not conniving like that.”  “We might need better contenders for the next Carmine contest.  Something better than an acorn-brained spirit.  Cut off the heads of this dragon before the knots stabilize and become permanent fixtures to our west, before the denizens of the undercities become people in their own right, before he changes his mind and decides to expand, or take more regions for strategic reason.”  “He’ll have plans, for the contest.  He’d be stupid not to.”  “I need better to bring to the council.  Eyes will roll if my suggestions begin and end with ‘kill the Carmine or the goddess.'”  “You have information.  Good information.”  “I need more.”  “I do have one suggestion.  It’s not especially elegant.”  “I don’t care about elegance.”  “They have really good cheesecake here.  If you’re looking for a next move, I suggest moving that direction.”  That drew a long sigh.  “After gin?”  “Sir?  Hi.  My acquaintance here needs a decadent dessert.  What would you suggest to go with gin?”  “Chocolate.”  “Double chocolate brownie?”  “That would be my suggestion, Ms. Behaim.”  “Double chocolate brownie.”  “And our… crisis?”  “A problem to face tomorrow.  We can talk tonight.”  🟂  Fifth Point of Order  First point of order: Subverting this very process.  Second point of order: Her power was used to hurt the children in her domain.  Third point of order: Failed to reach out to those in direst need.  Fourth point of order: She’s calcified enough she’s now neglecting iconic Alabaster duties & concepts.    Avery watched Verona walk up.  “Fifth point of order.  The handling of the forsworn,” Verona said.  “The forsworn are not under our jurisdiction once forsworn,” the Alabaster said.  “By the Law of the seal, you’re right,” Verona said.  “Technically, if you want to be hands-off with the forsworn, that’s your right.  But the moment Charles started bringing them in and weaponizing them, it became a totally different dynamic.  Again, there are expectations on you, you have a whole quadrant of stuff in your portfolio, including mercy, healing, restoration.  Protection of the weak against predation.”  “Is it predation or empowerment?” the teenage boy asked.  He had shorter hair than some of the people in the Alabaster’s domain, wavy and black, and had only a little laurel of white petals tucked in over one ear.  The cloth he wore was tied at one shoulder, leaving half his chest exposed.  “If I grab some dude off the streets and say hey, you work in my bookstore now, that’s sketchy as fuck.  But taking these guys and having them become soldiers of his?  Ones who fight, do shitty things on behalf of the Carmine’s goals, and get hurt.”  “They could leave at any time.  Didn’t the one leave the night Edith James died?”  “It’s not that easy to leave.  You presumably came from a bad situation, you found the Alabaster, you could leave at any time-”  “I did,” the boy replied.  “I left the Alabaster, I came back.”  “And you’re still so into it you’re willing to die if she dies?”  “Yes.  Because I believe in what she does.”  “I think that’s not a counter-argument, that’s, like, really illustrating the whole issue of screwed up power dynamics.  That’s sad, that’s screwed up.  You’re clearly young, you’re really good looking, healthy, apparently…”  “Is he hot?” Avery whispered to Lucy.  “Ho yeah,” Lucy whispered back.  Avery tilted her head.  “He’s got a weird jawline.”  “It’s a good weird.”  Avery sighed.  “Snow?”  “Nah, not that hot.  But it’s a good thing he doesn’t click his tongue or have thirteen nipples.”  “Yeah.”  “So nobody with wealth or power to pull someone out of a bad situation should?” the boy retorted.  “I mean, the fact there’s that much disparity in the first place…  I think the default employer-employee relationship is a bit screwed up, like, holy crap do I not want that ever, and this is worse.  Taking someone from being Forsworn?  That’s way more obligation and power imbalance.  Especially if there’s an implication that the rescue could be reversed.”  “Was that ever implied?”  “Isn’t it?  If he has the power to inflict it and take it away, what’s to say he won’t forswear them again if they upset him or go against him?”  “I think we’re getting sidetracked,” the regional spirit said.  Lucy spoke up, “The point is that the moment the forsworn were on the table for consideration, the Alabaster should have stepped in to act as a counterbalance to the Carmine’s aggression, and to ensure they had an escape route.”  “We have precedent,” Verona said.  “In three other cases we’ve been able to find, bad forswearings were reversed by a higher power, and in those instances, other powers got involved to balance things out, double check, and manage it.  Reversing a forswearing is a big deal.  It’s probably even a good thing… if it’s not being followed up by recruitment into some death squad.”  “You’re exaggerating,” the boy said.  “Horrification squad, maybe.  With some casual murder as frosting on the horror cake,” Verona said.  “Your precedent?” the regional spirit asked.  “Case one, manipulation of facts leading to forswearing.  Manipulation was proven, people went to the local Lord, all well and good, and a Judge- Azure in that case, closest to the one responsible, stepped in, made sure it all was kosher, especially because the Lord was acquaintances with the person who did the forswearing.”  “Where?” the Alabaster asked.  “Down in the States,” Avery said.  “Connecticut.  Roughly ten years ago.”  Sebastian Harless the contract guy had helped dig for this info.  “Case two,” Verona went on.  “Eritrea, Africa, a very long time ago.  But it’s cited in Law texts.  After being forsworn for a broken oath, a resin harvester sat for seven days and seven nights, considering the situation, picked himself up, and then went after the person who forswore him.  He challenged him, and in a fight marked by arguments for and against the forswearing, he won out.  A Judge-like figure basically blessed his victory and undid things on an official level, securing his travel out from the other guy’s estate.”  Harless had been really happy about that one, for some reason.  Like, digging that far back and finding something.  “And the third?”  “Out west.  About a century ago.  Turns out practitioners have a lot of ties to shitty history, and to Europe, and when the second world war was in full swing, there were a lot of practitioners who sided with the Axis instead of the Allies.  There was a general expectation that practitioners not get involved directly in the war, the same stuff that keeps us from running world governments and economies blocks war too, so that played into it.  But there was more than enough fighting to do in back circles back home.”  The regional spirit motioned for Verona to speed things up some.  “…Guy got tricked and forsworn, went to their Judge in Gray, whatever that is.  Our hero had a badass record with heaps of good karma, the pro-Nazi guy who did the forswearing really, really didn’t, so the Judge in Gray said they were willing to give the guy a shot.  Assigned him a really hard quest.  Didn’t work.  It was hard as balls and he lost, so…”  “This is one of your better examples?” the teenage boy asked.  “He had a real shot,” Verona replied.  “They gave him that.  No cheat, no tricks.  And, making this a better example, while the Judge in Gray handled stuff, it was another Judge that oversaw things, -”  “An Alabaster,” Lucy announced.  “Bitch,” Verona muttered, turning her head.  “Stealing my dramatic line?”  “Sorry.”  Verona turned to face the regional spirit and the Alabaster.  “Alabaster.  Specifically because the process was about mercy and forgiveness.”  “Response?  Counter-argument?”  The boy turned back, looking at the Alabaster.  “I don’t know enough about this.”  She stepped forward, running fingers through his hair as she passed.  “I don’t know much about what happens beyond my region.  Neighboring areas that have less oversight become clearer to me, but I wasn’t in position to see any of these events.”  “We have written record,” Verona said.  “Which can be manipulated, distorted by retelling, or outright lies.”  “One of the resources we used was a Law practice text.  A really standard, established, more-than-half-of-western-Law-practitioners-use-this one text.  Are you saying that this guy put something wrong in his text?”  “I’m saying I cannot know for certain.  Nor, I suspect, can you.”  “Again, I really want to make sure we’re clear.  This guy, a Law practitioner, a practitioner of the one practice where truth and justice are the biggest deal, out of all the practice categories and fields, you think he fudged things, got wrong?”  “I’m saying we cannot know.”  “This is getting circular,” the regional spirit said.  “Move on.”  “It’s a thing,” Verona said.  “If it were truly establishment, I would be obligated to do it as it’s established, as I am beholden to Law.  It’s not, so I am not.”  “There’s a lot of fudgey middle ground in the middle there,” Verona pointed out.  “Stuff that’s healthy and good to do for you and for everyone else, that’s part of your role, that isn’t one hundred percent locked in.  But you’re taking this stuff that other judges have accepted as part of the job and letting the opposite happen.”  “Show me the parts with the Forsworn,” the regional spirit said.  “Their involvement with the Carmine.  Any interactions with you.”  “Were there any interactions with you, Alabaster?” Lucy asked, voice pitched to be heard.  “Yes.”  “Fill us in?”  “I will fill the spirit in as part of this.  She can assess it and use it for her verdict.”  “I want to see too.  Because this is valid.  Or give us the loose details.  It could matter.”  “It doesn’t, as far as your argument is concerned.  Two of them petitioned me.  One on purpose, one by accident, after a day of wandering the woods.  Neither, as Verona Hayward admitted earlier, was obligatory.  There is no reason for me to answer or help the forsworn.”  “While they’re forsworn, anyway,” Verona said.  “What you imply is up for debate, and isn’t the condemnation of me you want it to be.”  The Alabaster began showing the spirit the scenes.  Lucy shook her head slightly.  “Sorry.  I feel like I could’ve zeroed in on the argument there.  I got caught up in arguing with the guy,” Verona told them, as she rejoined the group.  She looked back.  “So they aren’t one hundred percent filled in.”  Lucy shrugged.  “She knows us well enough, for reasons Guilherme explained.  The Carmine’s not the only one that’s been watching us, I guess.”  Verona frowned.  “So what, like, they have a lot of time to kill, so while they’re braiding flowers into their hair, they talk about all the major stuff?  Flowers, la dee dah, here’s how we’re justified in standing back while kids get turned into horrors, would you like more hair flowers, handsome?”  “The thing about crummy people,” Lucy said, “is a lot of them spend a lot of time obsessing over their shittiness.  Deep down, they know what they’re doing is wrong, but the energies that they’d spend on feeling guilty and changing stuff up becomes energy they spend on justifications and planning around avoiding consequences.”  Avery thought of Jeanine.  A bully, but not in the classic kids movie or after school special way.  Manipulative, holding nothing back, self-deluding, and just fucking ruining so many people’s high school years.  Alleging Avery was prostituting herself, almost outing Nora, almost blowing up the team like she had the gay-straight-alliance club.  “Becomes a trap,” Verona said.  “A cycle.  Once you start doing that, it becomes this whole thing where stopping and breaking from that habit of justifying, cheating, and bullshitting, it’s just too hard, so you sink further in.  Calcified shittiness.”  “And fighting it is a full time job we don’t have time for,” Avery said.  “Freaking Jeanine at my school, figure she’s thinking about the situation with me and the team and whatever ten hours a day.  Charles?  Twenty four hours a day?  He doesn’t sleep.  And then there’s us.”  “Doing okay?” Lucy asked.  She put a hand on Avery’s shoulder and rubbed it.  Snowdrop, in human form, bonked her head into Avery’s arm again.  Avery sighed.  It was warm enough in the clearing that her breath didn’t fog up.  Snowdrop opened her mouth and put Avery’s arm in between her teeth, play-biting.  Avery pulled her arm free, put an arm around Snowdrop, and rubbed Snow’s hair from the side.  “Getting worn out fast by this, I think,” Avery murmured.  “Being away?” Lucy asked.  “The crummy people.  Being away while having to watch our back.  And now I’ve got to give my argument, knowing it’s not our best one- we were going to put the less good ones, number three and four, toward the middle?”  “Yeah.”  “But with the shuffle, we replaced argument number three with the accusation she wasn’t playing fair ball with the pre-auditing argument, and then you swapped Verona’s and mine?”  Lucy nodded.  Avery looked across the clearing at the old lady who looked a bit like a hippie.  Something about her- Avery had the heebie jeebies.  “You’re on your own with this one,” Snowdrop told her.  “I think you’ve thoroughly proven you’re just awful at so much of this, you’re really a disappointing person nobody loves, but you gotta do this, you know?  It’s gotta be you, as much as the rest of us really don’t want it to be.”  “Thanks Snow.”  “Do you want us to take over?” Lucy asked.  “Lucy can take over.  I don’t like the public debate, public speaking stuff,” Verona said.  Avery shook her head.  “We’re stronger when we work together, right?”  “That means sometimes we back each other up when we’re down,” Lucy told her.  “It’s okay.  I want to do this.  It’s important, isn’t it?  Balancing out our roles?  Each of us to our strengths?”  Lucy nodded.  Avery looked skyward, up at the stars that were starting to come through the blue of the sky as the sun set.  The gentle light that streamed down from above was now in sunset hues.  Later, she guessed, it would be moonlight.  The light cut out.  The regional spirit lowered her chin, closing her eyes momentarily, before opening them again.  She reminded Avery of her mom.  “Next point of order?”  It was time.  Into the metaphorical arena.  🟂  “…the sixty-first, I am he who is fearless, literally made that way, and who will not balk in fighting or reciting my titles, whatever threats are made, for my titles, to remind you once again, were given to me by Verona Hayward, witch and guardian of Kennet, nascent sorceress, dabbler in halflight and shadow, she who shattered the moon, founder of Kennet found, enforcer of Kennet below, speaker for the voiceless, by Avery Kelly, second Witch of Kennet, Finder and Path Runner, Promenade Solver, partner to the opossum spirit Snowdrop, by Lucy Ellingson…”  The squirrel dragged sharp claws meant for tree climbing down her cheeks, one caught on an eyelid, dragging it down.  The small shield she had rested against the tree slipped and fell over.  “…duelist, and bearer of fang, smoke, and steel.  The sixty-second of which, I must tell you, is that I am he who will pause to ask my audience to recite, all together, my last five titles, the fifty-sixth, the fifty-seventh, the fifty-eighth, the fifty-ninth, the sixtieth, and the sixty-first, so I may be sure you’re listening, and do finish with a huzzah, if you please.”  The squirrel, nails still digging into fur, one eyelid still pulled down, not quite drawing blood but coming close, turned her head to look up at the Carmine.  “Promptly, please, brave knight,” Percival Awarnach of the ninety-nine titles said, smiling.  He only had teeth in his mouth for the sound effect in the thirty-eighth and thirty-ninth title, and for the seventeenth, when he demonstrated his winning smile, so his current smile was just an upturned hole in his little spirit face.  “Brave knight?  Should I restart?”  The squirrel knight made a groaning sound.  “Brave knight?”  “I did tell you to listen carefully, especially titles fifty-six through sixty-one,” the Carmine  told the Squirrel, sitting with an elbow on his knee, hand on his cheek.  His breath fogged in the cold.  “Also to mind the loop he’ll throw in around title eighty, where he goes back in the count.”  “Brave knight?” Percival Awarnach of the ninety-nine titles asked, stumping around.  “Very well, I shall begin anew.  May I have your full attention?”  “Sir,” the squirrel said, composing herself.  She picked up her shield and dusted the snow off it, fixed her little squirrel dress with the armor hanging loose over it, and her little helmet.  She approached the Carmine.  “Brave knight?  May I-” Percival asked.  “Shut up!” the squirrel retorted.  “I must insist I be allowed-”  “Shut up!  Glamour and nuts!  I-” she turned to the Carmine, little black eyes widening.  “That was unbecoming of me, Carmine Judge.  I’m sorry.”  “That’s alright.”  She bent down into a kneeling bow, planting sword into the ground.  “I am but a humble knight, come this far south because foul enemies plague Bayberry.  I thought I might fight in this contest, to win the ability to drive them away.”  “You stand no real chance of winning.”  “Brave knight!  May I have your attention?” Percival asked, in the background.  “I’ve already finished with the other gentleman, who went off into the woods-”  To be away from you.  She ignored him, talking to the Carmine instead.  “I think I knew that, sir.  Perhaps, if the universe is a just place, it will find a way to mean something.”  “The universe is not just,” the Carmine replied.  “You and your kind bear that truth forward as much as any do.”  “Very well, that is unfortunately true,” the squirrel knight replied, still bowing low.  “I still have to try.  I’m sorry this contest puts us at odds.”  “Brave knight!”  The squirrel’s paw tightened around the grip of her sword, point embedded in the crust of the snow.  “May I ask a different kindness of you?  My brain is the size of a walnut, which I think is the finest size for a brain to be, not too large and not too small.”  The Carmine nodded.  “Yet it is not large enough to hold what he demands I hold.  All those words.”  “Can you read off a paper?” the Carmine asked.  “I cannot read, sir.  I am a squirrel,” she replied, bewildered at the idea.  “Ah.  Hmm.”  “I, Ridget Fallbranch, high knight of the Russet Squirrels of Bayberry, guardian of the crossing between High Spring and Northern Canada… I do suppose you are sick of titles.”  “Yes.”  She straightened, a twinkle in her eye, a hint of a smile on a mouth not suited to smiling, and held the sword fast against her little breastplate.  “Place grant me the grace of being allowed to execute that foul spirit now.”  “That is a grace I cannot grant, as much as I may want to.  He initiated the contest, and he is in his rights to ask for certain terms.  Three days and three nights will pass, allowing time for contestants to gather, and then we will begin.  At his request, he will introduce himself in full to each contestant.”  “So you’ve said.  May I depart, refusing this contest?”  “No.  You’ve sealed yourself to it by your arrival.”  She looked down, then up.  “Will you help me learn what I must learn, so I can answer his introduction, and allow me to fight him in the first round so I may be the one to cleave him in two?”  “I can try.  You do not need to learn all of it.  A huzzah-”  “Huzzah!” came the cry from the background.  “-will distract him and confuse his programming.”  “Programming, Judge?”  “It will allow you to trick him, where you might otherwise stumble.”  “I see.  My gracious thanks.”  “Another approaches.”  “Oh no.  Each that comes, they will be one more set of introductions!”  “That’s true.”  She scrambled, using her years of knightly training for a trace more speed.  Her ears twitched, catching the sound of footsteps in snow.  She climbed a tree, bounding from branch to branch.  She reached the threshold, the bounds of this contest, and she threw herself outward, catching another branch, despite the weight of her armor.  She climbed up to stand straight, and put her paws out, as if to bar the way of the human that came through the trees.  “Cease!  Nothing good waits for you here!  This is not a grand contest, but a torture!”  The human ignored her, walking past, into the clearing.  “New Sir!” Percival perked up.  “Welcome!  I am Percival Awarnach of the ninety-nine titles, the first of which is that I was…”  The human looked back, and looked around.  He fixed his eyes on the Carmine and Sable.  “This is the right spot?”  “It is.”  “Sir, may I have your attention!?”  “He’s the only challenger?”  “The squirrel was another.  There’s also another man, a cursed Innocent, off in the woods, he found a place to lie down and wait.”  “What happened to… the rest?”  “Everyone strong who’d accept a contest like this fought and died at Summer’s end.  Percival over there called this contest, as part of that, he’s requested three days and three nights to wait for more contestants, and that he be allowed to introduce himself in full.  We cannot deny him that, as he draws power from it.”  The man looked at Percival, skeptical, then smirked.  “It’s a terrible thing,” Ridget told him.  “It doesn’t matter if you do it now or wait,” the Carmine said.  The man sat down, and Percival walked over.  “Over the first six years of my life, I trained to be a knight,” Ridget told the Carmine.  “Over seven more years, I worked as a knight, guarding the crossing against foulest enemies, leading forays against those same enemy camps and settlements.  I fought hard, married, had two litters of kits.  I recieved two commendations, one for leading a breach of the gates, and one after a successful year-long campaign.  See?”  She showed off her two medals, pinned to her cape.  “Small, but I see.”  She looked past the Carmine to the Sable.  “I trained two generations of soldiers, three squires, two of whom became very good knights.  I’m old.  I thought I would fight for change, to change the tides of the war, before my body slows too much.  I hoped for a noble end, even if my chances of success were slim.”  “I’m sorry.”  “Inanity and then oblivion?” she asked.  She watched Percival prattle on.  The practitioner he talked to seemed to be realizing what he was in for.  “Three days and three nights of inanity?”  “I’m afraid so,” he said, his voice a growl.  “Sable Judge?  Will you take me when I die?”  “No.  Oblivion will.  It is a cost of this contest, that no trace be left.”  “Inanity for three days and three nights, then oblivion?”  “A flash of steel just before oblivion,” the Carmine said.  “That counts for little, I worry,” Ridget told him.  “It does.”  “What is the best way to pass these days and nights?” she asked.  “You would do well to memorize the lines you need to memorize, if only so we can move swiftly through the introductory segment of this contest.”  “May I first sing a song?  If my life is to be a tragedy, I’d like the chance to have a song to fit.  An anthem of the original knights of the Russets of Highhome, I’ve known it to be sung with a sadder tone to it.”  “I will not stop you.”  She lifted weapon and shield aside, finding a snow-dusted rock to stand on, and she began to sing.  A war song and anthem of Highhome, promising the extermination of the black and gray squirrel kingdoms.  The blacks, who were brutish and savage, and the grays, who were savage and brutish.  The song promised bloodless executions, for the russets -the red-furred- were the noblest of squirrels, and blood was reserved for battlefields.  They would use hot steel to sear their enemies, so they might be sterilized and muted, as befit the beasts they were, for black and gray, king and peasant, male and-  “Perhaps,” the Carmine said.  “Without the words.”  She switched to wordless singing, occasionally banging the flat of her sword against shield for punctuation.  She finished.  “Lord Judge?”  “What is it?”  “Three times, I met champions of enemy forces.  Three times, we had an exchange of blows.  Three times, I slew my foe.  If Percival is allowed his introductions…”  “Hello,” Percival said, in the background, smiling a toothless smile.  “…I’d ask to be allowed mine.  A flash of steel, as you describe.”  The Carmine glanced at the Sable.  The Sable nodded.  “I think we can fudge that,” the Carmine said.  “That would expedite things.  But we must still wait for the contenders who’ve decided to come.  It won’t be three days and three nights, but it won’t be immediate either.”  She bowed, kneeling.  “Thank you, Judge.”  🟂  Sixth Point of Order  First point of order: Subverting this very process.  Second point of order: Her power was used to hurt the children in her domain.  Third point of order: Failed to reach out to those in direst need.  Fourth point of order: She’s calcified enough she’s now neglecting iconic Alabaster duties & concepts.  Fifth point of order: noninvolvement with the Forsworn, even after they were brought into the Judges’ custody.    “…so, through action and inaction both, by standing by like she did and breaching Kennet, she failed to fulfill yet another of her functions as Alabaster, protecting sanctuaries and warded spaces.”  “Do you know what the word projection means?” the old woman asked.  Avery’s heart thumped in her chest.  Snowdrop stood close to her, body pressed against Avery’s side.  It sucked that she really needed it.  “Once upon a time, I was a therapist.  But I took too many of my patient’s demons on as my own.  I still remember what I need to remember.  The accusations you’re laying against the Alabaster, you might as well be blaming yourselves.”  Avery shook her head.  “You accuse her of gaming this system, but you set up this entire process as a skewed game, intended to remove her.”  “She has the chance to say she won’t work with Charles,” Avery replied.  “You have the chance to say you will work with him.  That answers most of your problems.”  “And creates so many more new ones,” Avery replied.  She hated she was reminded of the Wolf so much here.  This woman was the opposite of Avery’s Wolf in every way except she was old and confrontational.  “In your second point, power used to hurt children?  You contrived an excuse to attack practitioners of your town in the midst of truce.”  “They attacked our allies.  They did make the first move.”  “You made the first move by interfering.  You should have let things be and been let be.  Third point?  You yourselves have failed the Others you promised to be stewards of.  You, Avery Kelly, left Kennet.”  Avery swallowed hard.  “Physically?  Yes, temporarily, but in other ways?  In heart?”  “Careful what you say, child,” the old woman told her.  “The Alabaster oversees love.  She knows your heart isn’t entirely in Kennet.  You’ve been tempted to stay with another.”  “Woo dang, Avery!” Verona whooped.  “No interruptions,” the regional spirit said.  Not like that, Ronnie, Avery thought.  “Fourth point?” the old woman asked.  “Don’t you dare say we calcified,” Lucy said.  “No, but you’ve gone down your own paths, too caught up in them to see what you’re missing.  You want the Alabaster to be wholly dedicated to her job but you get so excited about magic school you let the town be attacked, weakened.  You focus on family, and friends, on hobbies-”  “It’s different,” Avery said, knowing that sounded weak.  “We’re human.  She’s a greater power.  We’ve seen and been Carmine, we’ve tasted that power, the scope of responsibility.  We’ve had a sense of what someone truly dedicated will do- we’ve heard about it with Ted Havens.  And we’ve seen what a broken, lonely Judge does or fails to do.  Something’s wrong with the Alabaster.”  “Something, Avery Kelly,” the old woman said, “is wrong with the three of you, then.”  “Bull,” Verona muttered.  “Fifth point.  You would call the Forsworn monsters, but you yourselves align with those monsters.   You focused so hard on fighting your enemies that you’ve neglected to stop evils within.”  “This again?” Lucy asked.  “Is it ‘again’?  Was this a chapter that was ever closed?  One leader demoted, temporarily, before you gave him duties of another sort?  You’ve felt Rook was a traitor, but you sit on that, hoping more than knowing that there’s more to it.  You ally with the likes of Florin Pesch and Odis Saulsbury.  Your opossum familiar is fond of Cherrypop, who would murder if she could.”  “You’ve got her exactly right,” Snowdrop replied, dead serious.  The Alabaster was too calm.  Not panicking, not worried…  “Sixth point?  You took on custodianship of Kennet as guardians.  You swore in your awakening you’d protect the town.”  “We’ve given a lot of ourselves, gotten hurt, fought.”  “But was the town sufficiently protected?  Were people endangered?  Were lives lost?”  “A lot of that happened because of Charles, you know?  Him and his co-conspirators murdered those three teens.  He drew negative attention to Kennet and spurred Musser’s attack.”  “With Alabaster power,” Lucy added.  “But were they protected, were lives lost?  Is Kennet safe right now?”  “I don’t know.”  “You don’t know.  When you view scenes to support these arguments, please look at their failures as much as you look at any of the Alabaster’s.”  “Look for successes, and effort too,” Avery said.  “And look for what we talked about.  The Legendres, much as I’m not a fan of what they do with exterminations of Others, they sealed away things like the Beorgmann-”  “And let it free in desperation when attacked by you.”  “But they sealed it.  The only reason she was there was because it wears out.  It takes very little for something like the Alabaster to control that damage.  We need more.”  The Alabaster was too calm and they were reaching the last of their arguments.  This wasn’t the strongest argument but it did count for something.  What did the Alabaster have up her sleeve?  What could she have up her sleeve?  Avery hated standing still.  She itched to move, to go.  Avery kissed the top of Snowdrop’s head, mussing up her hair afterward.  The Alabaster was preparing to show the regional spirit what she needed to see.  Was that it?  Were Lucy’s instincts right?  Snowdrop was warm against her side.  Arrivals and destinations.  And finding moments to be still with people you’re fond of.  Arrivals and destinations.  Beginnings and endings.  “We want to see,” Avery called out.  “See what?” the regional spirit asked.  “What you’re showing her.  What segments.  The bias, if any.”  “You think I wouldn’t notice something like bias right under my nose?” the regional spirit asked.  “I think… the Alabaster is very, very old.  She’s watched people for a long time, and people-”  She thought of her Grumble, sitting in front of a television, angry men stoking anger and indignation and talking shit about trans people and gay kids and immigrants.  Her grandfather, who’d given her stiff, rough hugs, so often, just absorbing it all, taking it in uncritically.  “-people buy into that too easily.  Even good people.  I want to see.”  “You have the benefit of delivering the opening argument, deciding the challenge-”  “And you get to hear and see as we do it.  We want to hear and see as you do your part,” Lucy said.  The old woman had moved to the Alabaster’s side.  “Come, then.”  Avery hesitated.  “We want to see it all,” Lucy said.  The Alabaster put out a hand.  Fingers twitched, beckoning.  Avery steeled herself, then approached.  The old woman smiling.  She was back in the Wolf’s den, guck on her eyes, half-blinding her, alone.  A smiling, confident old woman vascillating between verbal abuse and a sickly kind of charm, trying to throw her off.  Using her knowledge of Avery.  She could taste sick in her throat, chest locked up so tight it was like it squeezed her stomach and forced acid and throw-up taste the wrong way up.  Miss had come.  Had distracted her.  Hadn’t been able to shield her completely.  Sudden movements of even her Grumble’s hand spooked her.  She’d been shaky, sleepless, and Guilherme-  Guilherme was here.  -Guilherme had given her the mindfulness trick, to reward herself with golden checkmarks for her successes, for conquering fears.  Every step she took now, willingly toward two very old, hostile women, it felt like it was taking her back.  Snowdrop was beside her.  Guilherme behind her.  Lucy and Verona caught up.  Her best friends were with her.  The Alabaster looked down on her with those eyes that were ageless and deep and dark.  The woman’s hand went out, and the light speared down.  Blinding her not with dark guck and spittle, but moonlight, now.  🟂  Ridget the squirrel knight twitched violently as she crawled across snow.  Metal raked across the texture of the crust on the snow, like a metal tool dragged down a section of road, start, stop, start, stop, timed with her finding the strength to pull herself forward.  She bit into Percival’s acorn, long since scattered from the little spirit’s being, tearing it partially open, before she died.  Her little sword turned against Percival had started this event.  Her bite into the acorn marked the beginning of the end of it.  Just Charles now, and the red-haired goblin, nine feet tall and rangy, with blood-soaked tangles of hair hanging to the ground, where they piled up.  “Ah’m not here to beat you,” the goblin told Charles.  “Gerhild.  The Redcap Queen,” Charles replied.  “She wanted you to know she’ll help you.  You help her get what she wants, she’ll help secure what you want.”  “There are easier ways to get a message to me.”  “The way she thinks?  The bloody way is the best way.”  Charles nodded.  He began changing his domain.  The Carmine clearing.  Trees moved away, and he forged his arena.  His second, really.  Kennet, or a version of it, broken and bloody, surrounded them.  A gap separated them.  “I don’t need her,” Charles said.  “Our contest here will be about summons.  Creating something Other, pitting them against one another.”  “She can give you so much.  Power.”  “I have power.”  “Intimidation of your enemies.”  “I have that in spades.”  “Weapons.”  “I can make living weapons.”  “An army.”  “I have an army.”  “Your summons?  Those are-”  “No.  Others.”  The goblin snorted.  “If you’re not capable of creating something to fight my something, you’re in your rights to ask for the tools to do so.”  “Nah,” the goblin replied, before smiling a wide, literally ear to ear smile.  There were teeth inside the ears.  “If you change your mind?  If you need it?  Take a piece of me and burn it to call her.  Insurance.”  Charles nodded.  The goblin reached up, and dug two-inch claw tips into his own throat.  His smile stretched to something macabre, he maintained eye contact, and he pulled at his own throat as bloody ribbons of flesh stretched out to their limit and snapped.  Until he’d torn the front end of his own throat out, his knees went weak, and he perished, dying just before he hit the ground, so the impact could start to unmake the arena.  A bit of power saved for another conflict in the future.  Charles walked forward.  He collected his insurance from the goblin corpse’s hand.  His arena came to pieces, dissipating.  He could have maintained it, but he didn’t.  The Sable collected the bodies, leaving only Charles’ trophy as the last remaining sign of it all.  The red sky became something black, and he left Kennet behind to be in part of the woods at the border of Eastern Ontario where the contest had begun.  The bodies were gone before there was any chance even a stray bird could see anything.  Maricica was there, taller than treetops, looming over the scene.  Her people were in the woods, enough of them that some could stand shoulder to shoulder.  The idea had been that if someone removed him, she would remove them promptly, and carry on where he’d left off.  At least until someone could figure out what was needed to destroy an Abyssal schemer with the powers of a Goddess and Carmine both.  “You made it through.”  “Hardly a contest.  Have you woken up?”  “I’ve woken many of them up.  Everything’s moving along nicely.”  “What was the ploy?  What did they attack or retake?”  Maricica, naked and glorious and forever drenched in blood, smiled.  🟂  Seventh Point of Order  First point of order: Subverting this very process.  Second point of order: Her power was used to hurt the children in her domain.  Third point of order: Failed to reach out to those in direst need.  Fourth point of order: She’s calcified enough she’s now neglecting iconic Alabaster duties & concepts.  Fifth point of order: noninvolvement with the Forsworn, even after they were brought into the Judges’ custody.  Sixth point of order: A dereliction of duty in protection of what needed protection, to uphold sanctuaries, or maintaining wards.    “I’ve seen enough,” the regional spirit’s voice echoed through the storm of flashbacks, images, and scenes.  “Have you shown me what I need to see, for this first point?”  “Yes,” Avery said.  “I think so.”  The scenes fled, melting away.  They’d worked backwards.  Revisiting scenes.  Making small amendments.  The Alabaster’s demeanor had changed with that.  It had felt like she wasn’t arguing back, but… the argument had always been in the presentation of the facts.  In ways too hard to easily put words to, even seconds after leaving it behind.  Dwelling here, moving there.  Focusing on certain words.  All factual, as Law required, but even math could mislead, presented a certain way.  Fuck, had Avery just quoted Mr. Sitton from last year?  Fuck.  It felt a bit like they’d won.  They just needed to get this across the finish line, now.  “When we present our final point of order, are you going to put forward another representative, like an old woman for me, when I have a minor phobia?” Avery asked.  “Hot boy for Verona?”  “The parent,” Verona said.  “The scarred lady.  They were meant to push subtle buttons, right?”  Guilherme was still there, watching over things.  He probably would be a bit annoyed they were cutting right past the subtlety, instead of using it.  “What buttons are you going to push this time?” Avery asked.  “None.  I’ll stand for myself.”  “Seventh point of order.  The Carmine Contest.”  “The contents of the contest are private.”  “To keep contestants from learning tricks and things.  We can swear never to attempt to be Carmine, and not to divulge, outside of those present,” Lucy said.  “But I want to see how this played out.  It doesn’t feel right.”  The Alabaster turned away.  “Make your argumen-”  Lucy reached out, grabbing.  She missed, but Avery was already moving, stepping out in front, to block the Alabaster, Snowdrop a step behind, arms spread.  Verona backed up, to get a fuller view of what was going on, hand in her pocket.  This time, Avery blocking, Lucy succeeded in grabbing the woman’s wrist.  She moved the Alabaster’s hand to the position where it had been when she’d last delivered the visions of the scenes.  “This is a full audit.  Show us.”  “Do,” the regional spirit said.  “As I saw it, then.”  🟂  The Alabaster Doe endured an existence of paradoxes. Few things drove that home as much as her role here at the arena. An architect of mercy paying witness to a fierce battle of strength…  “I don’t think you’re enduring an existence of paradoxes.  I think you’re just doing a really shitty job at what an Alabaster’s meant to do,” Lucy said.  🟂  John fought the giant Faerie Wolf thing.  The Ondvarg.  “Make your argument as we watch.”  “The Judges propped John up as the presumptive candidate.  They made a promise to him, that they’d free his bound comrades, the Dog Tags,” Lucy said.  “In exchange, he’d be the challenger for the contest.  First and last to fight.”  “There was no guarantee he’d survive.”  “Use your Sight,” Verona whispered, eyes glowing, as they stood back and watched the scene.  Avery did.  The Ondvarg created his cast of supporting characters, forged out of glamour, or called from somewhere.  He grew the antlers of a deer and grew a tree from the antlers, and the tree grew out and through the Arena.  Breaching it.  False deer, illusion, pack hunters.  Avery saw it.  The ephing bird.  The ephemeral bird.  She saw the connection.  She reached out, drawing a line in the air with a finger, pointing for the benefit of the others.  Verona pushed a card into Avery’s hand.  The gate of horn.  Verona and Lucy had complementary cards.  Verona handed one to the spirit.  Avery moved, tracking it.  A pinch of glamour- they were in a vision, it hardly mattered, but it let her paint within this replayed scene.  Tracing the line better.  A line of intent, between Ondvarg and bird.  Another line, of understanding.   Ondvarg and Alabaster.  The line flowered.  “Connected by nature,” the Alabaster murmured.  A line from Alabaster to bird.  Simpler.  The line extended past the bird, as if the Alabaster knew in full what the bird would do.  Avery used the fake glamour to make a fake transformation, pushing out.  Not so different from an Alcazar, just more flexible.  She turned them all into birds so their view of the scene could track the bird as it flew through the hole in the building.  She made sure to trace the line of foresight and knowledge from the Alabaster while they followed the bird.  The pause, bird waiting in the trees by the arena, as smoke poured out of the hole in the exterior.  There was fighting and conflict, negotiation, and the approach.  They could not stop Charles from entering.  But they had the ring.  Until the bird stole it.  Lucy seized the connection between bird and Albaster with her talons, pulling.  Wrenching the scene.  It connected.  She knew.  “You let Charles win.  You didn’t just give him the mandate when he came with the furs.  You helped,” Lucy said, voice thick with feelings.  “You all asked John to compete and then you fucked him.”  Lucy’s face screwed up, fists clenched.  “That ain’t right.”  “Gotta say,” Verona said.  “You don’t set up good deals with champions, heroes, or whatever to clean up messes, like other Alabasters do.  You screwed over the closest thing we’ve seen to someone doing that, John.”  “I gave him the opportunity to succeed, if he could find it to take it.”  “You took away opportunity,” Lucy told her.  “You don’t support sanctuaries or protected territories, or help in any clear way with the wards around key spaces,” Avery said.  “I protect my own, a place of last resort for those who can reach it, and I stand ready to expand and empower it if all else is lost.”  “You don’t help the forsworn, even when they’re clearly in your jurisdiction,” Verona said.  “I let them help themselves, and find their own strength.”  “You’ve neglected key duties, basic stuff with wrinkles, just like a calcified Incarnation does,” Avery said.  “You’ve gone stiff, you’ve forgotten your roots.”  “I am the roots of this region.  I remain stable and sure to be in contrast to the other Judges who change.  I survive,  because we need to know that something can.”  “You’ve failed kids who were horrored, you’ve failed a man embracing a poison pot for who knows how much longer, the Beorgmann’s prisoner kids?  How many others?”  “I’m where I am if they can reach me.  But I will not chase victory against the Beorgmann, try to reason with a madman clutching an empty pot, or save a girl from her own recklessness.  To do so would be fruitless, encourage them to embrace their mistakes, or both.  Better I conserve power so I can help others who need it over the long term, than seek smaller victories in the now.”  “You let Charles take your power and use it to gainsay kids and get them sent back to abusive households and dangerous situations,” Avery said.  “If you’re not going to protect kids, at the very least, what the heck are you going to protect?  “Her suicidal fan club,” Verona added.  “He was going to take the power regardless.  Better I stay, watch, wait, and bide my time, fix what most needs fixing when the damage is done.”  “You’re fucking with us this entire way, manipulating the situation-”  “Surviving.”  “Alabaster,” Lucy said.  She had moisture in her eyes and anger on her face.  “What the fuck is it you even do, while you’re spending all this time occupying this important position?”  The Alabaster showed them.  Centuries, total, in glimpses and moments.  Initially, she acted.  Initially, she removed dangers.  But as time went on, she spread herself thinner, conserved more.  Instead of saving someone, she gave them a small burst of energy, to try again.  If they had the strength.  Instead of securing a ward, she created a reminder- a glimpse of light in shadow, that resembled a threat, so the Warden might pick up the pace, visit that warding site earlier.  And if that thing got loose… not her fault.  Conservation, efficiency, hoarding power, letting others solve small problems, waiting until there was a big one.  Acting.  A clear event which needed intervention, that turned out to provide something?  That, she paid for.  “If I did not do this, there is a good chance I would have failed long ago, bankrupt of karmic power in a time of need.”  “By not spending you let problems grow until they’re almost insurmountable.  The Beorgmann’s a big one,”  Verona said.  “On the rare occasion.  But most times, others handle it.  Most times, the problems remain surmoutnable.”  “And Charles?” Avery asked.  “I expect to get back what I put into him.  It is the only guaranteed way past this turning point in the region’s history.”  “Unless someone notices you’re reaping the karma while not keeping up what needs keeping up,” Verona remarked.  “I get us through.”  “You didn’t get John Stiles through.”  Lucy moved her hand.  The Alabaster obliged.  Taking them back to the Arena.  Through the scenes.  Through dialogue.  It wasn’t fast-forwarded, but they got the gist of it all in moments.  Lucy nodded.  “You guys said it’d count.  That he took you up on the offer.  That he fought first.  That he proved himself, every step of the way.  Then you just let the whole Charles deal unfold over a century, let Charles walk through the doors with the furs on?  A forsworn guy?”  “You failed too.  In parallels.  The same way I failed,” the Alabaster said.  “You failed him too.”  “Fuck you,” Lucy spat the words back, no hesitation.  “We’re trying,” Avery said.  “We’re pushing our limits.  We’re growing.  We’re helping others grow, I think.  I don’t think anything about you or what you’re doing has pushed limits, grown, or helped others grow in a long time.”  Lucy walked around the scene, around John.  “Have you reached a verdict?  All the intelligent Others and people and practitioners of the region?” Verona asked.  “We have,” the regional spirit replied.  “Will it be a nasty surprise?”  “No.  Not for you three, not for your familiar.”  The Alabaster took that in, leaning back slightly, eyes widening.  “I wonder if that’s the most you’ve felt alive, in the last however the fuck long,” Lucy said.  “I felt alive when the Carmine Exile emerged from the building.  It was interesting.  Interesting doesn’t often reach into my sort of domain.  Not after this long.”  “Swear to change, to amend everything we’ve pointed out, to try.  To be the balancing force you need to be,” Avery offered.  The Alabaster let the vision fall to pieces.  Lucy moved.  Pulling out her compact.  Drawing in the air with glamour.  Seizing the image of John from the middle of the contest, his Dog Tags around him.  Wearing his coat, red, like hers.  She reached for his gun, and the glamour in her hand expanded out to capture the image and give it some form.  John posed, aiming the gun, moving as Lucy did.  “That’s an illusion,” the Albaster said.  “Glamour.”  Lucy reached for her neck, hooked a thumb around her chain necklace, and pulled out the various dog tags and the rings at the end.  She slid her fingers through the weapon ring and Yalda’s ring both.  Turned what she was holding into a real weapon.  “There you go,” the Alabaster replied.  To the spirit, she said, “You’ll be required to take the seat.  It doesn’t suit the collective of the people of the region.  It’ll destroy you.”  “They made me so I could.  The parts of me that can lead, parent, manage, I can push them up and forward.”  “I see.”  The Alabaster’s eyes changed as she said it.  So she could see.  She looked around at her people, standing at the edge of trees and clearing, or sitting on branches.  “I need permission,” Lucy said.  “You don’t have to be the one to do this,” Avery said.  “Not again.  Not after Alexander.”  “I want to.”  “Okay.  Permission granted.”  Verona walked up, standing behind her friend, hand at Lucy’s shoulder.  Like she could brace Lucy from behind while Lucy shot.  “You’ll mess up my stance.”  “I trust you to hit what you’re shooting,” Verona said.  “Go for it.”  Lucy looked over at the spirit.  “I take all onus and responsibility onto myself,” the spirit replied, words measured, “as I give permission.”  “No onus.  She’s supposed to curse people who kill her like Yalda did,” Lucy said.  “But she did this to herself, slowly, over centuries, and then capped it off with what I call point of order number seven: yanking the chain of a certain Dog of War to support someone like Charles Abrams.”  The chain at Lucy’s neck jangled.  One hand held the gun, the other was poised right in front of her, fingers at odd angles, to have the rings through them.  Lucy pulled the trigger.  \", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': 13.479026615481597, 'meta': {'arc_title': 'In Absentia', 'pov': 'Avery', 'wordcount': '12744', 'series_chapter_number': 255, 'arc_number': '21', 'extra_material': False, 'title': 'In Absentia - 21.6', 'chapter': '21.6'}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '46e72a9bae9fc441cf65c177a861aa09'}>,\n",
      "               <Document: {'content': '    The summer heat pressed on her, bugs kept landing on her, both flies to sip at her sweat, and mosquitoes, to go one layer deeper.  She wanted it to be cold again.  Thick sweater weather, mosquitoes in hiding… she didn’t want it to be cold again.  The end of summer brought things she didn’t want to think about.  It felt like the only way to view that point in time was to hold it in her mind’s eye, an image like a mirror with a crack diagonally across it, one portion showing one scene, the other with its angle changed, showing something completely different.  There was no way to bring that scene into clear focus.  The start of the school year.  Leaving the Long Sleepover.  Whatever happened, however things happened, it would change so many things in this world of practice, here in Kennet.  The bracelet clicked.  The group of them were being watched as they walked from Avery’s house.  Zed was wearing a black t-shirt with sleeves rolled up a bit past fair-sized biceps, black jeans, and a belt with metal on it.  His hair was glossy, he wore sunglasses, and carried a heavy bag.  Riding the line between Grease and that 90s movie she’d never gotten around to seeing.  Beside him, Brie was wearing what was probably the most sensible summer clothing out of all of them, a red summer-weight dress that blew this way and that.  The tattoos were visible on her arms, legs, and neck, bold striking lines and text, circles depicting the phases of the moon running from the soft part of her inner elbow to her wrist.  Her face and hair didn’t quite match the dress, when it looked like she’d be more comfortable somehow in more casual clothes to suit her ‘pretty girl next door’ look, but confidence closed the gap.  To Verona’s annoyingly blurry, limited Sight, Brie looked a lot more like the individual parts of her aligned together.  Less of a shattered mirror, maybe.  Jessica’s hair was wet.  She’d dipped into the river, even though the water level was low, and then she’d changed into denim shorts, a tank top and sandals.  She’d left her hair wet but braided, letting the morning heat dry it.  The checkerboard ‘loon’ tattoo encircling her arm had been joined by another, currently under a bandage.  Verona bumped her shoulder into Lucy’s arm.  “Yeah, yeah, I know,” Lucy said, elbowing Verona away.  “Don’t cling.  It’s too hot out.”  “Hm?  What are you ‘yeah-yeahing-I-know’ing about?” Avery asked, peering past Lucy at Verona.  “And tell Snowdrop that.  Little ball of heat in my backpack.”  There was a noise from the bag.  “Isn’t she hot?” Lucy asked.  “I have a bunch of stuff from the fridge and some water frozen in water bottles in there.  It’s going to have wiry opossum hairs on it when I go to drink.  She gets to be cool and I get a cold lower back and a ball of heat up closer by my shoulder blades.”  There was another small sound from the bag.  Verona smiled.  “What were you and Lucy yeah-yeahing about?” Avery asked.  Verona adjusted her bracelet, tapping it.  “Oh, yeah.  For a little while now,” Avery agreed.  Yeah, but it’s a problem since we’re getting closer to the destination, and we can’t enter until the coast is clear.  “What’s this?” Zed asked.  “I’ll text you,” Avery told him.  “I just had an eerie flashback,” Brie said.  “Seeing you three together…”  “The night we met you for the Hungry Choir thing?” Verona asked.  Lucy elbowed her.  “Yeah,” Brie said.  “That was my first time here, then I came back, but it felt dreamlike.  Still does.  Like that night was real and the rest of this is pretend.  And you three are so- you’re at home here.  My brain keeps going from seeing you together in this weird place to remembering you together in a weird Choired version of this place.”  “It’s going to get weirder later today, if we pull this off,” Zed said.  “Woo,” Verona replied.  “So, Verona,” Avery said.  “While you were sleeping in…”  “Resting in advance of a difficult major ritual.”  “We’re doing the ritual too,” Lucy told her.  “And Avery and I got up early.”  “Your choice.  Technically the shrine thing doesn’t have to be done at ass o’clock in the morning.”  “Getting back on track,” Avery said.  “We did the shrine thing with Jessica.  So, for your benefit, and Zed’s, and Brie’s… we’ve been doing it a bit wrong.”  “Oh no,” Verona said.  “How wrong?”  “It’s fixable,” Jessica said.  “But doing one quarter at a time leaves you with weak points.  Imagine… imagine you’re filling bowls with water every time you visit the shrines.  At the same time you’re doing that, the other bowls are evaporating.  You’re doing two a day, one quarter at a time, and by the time you get back to one… it’s been getting close to empty for a little while.”  “Not enough water to put out fires,” Zed said.  “Yes,” Jessica said.  “We could visit more, I guess?” Avery asked.  “You could, and that would help, but only because it’s more attention and attention is power.”  “Isn’t that the whole point?” Verona asked.  Jessica nodded.  “Yes, but balance is part of the point too.  A table supported by twelve legs is harder to topple than one with four.”  “Humans build tables with four legs… pretty much all the time,” Lucy said.  “They do, but our worry with these sorts of diagrams and shrine arrangements is that there are people out there who want to knock over the table.  If all they have to do is take out one leg that hasn’t been attended to recently…”  “Right,” Lucy said.  “When we did the awakening diagram, way back at the beginning, we were told it was something like a surface or a spinning plate that was tilting one way or another, depending on the emphasis,” Verona said.  “Yes.  And you’re adjusting it purely by lifting up an edge by one of four general directions.”  “Warding stuff gets pretty complicated,” Zed said.  “Some things, uh, you really want to keep them stuck under a ward for a few centuries or a few thousand years.  And when you’re talking about caging stuff that big, for that long, even the smallest weakness will be exploited or magnified over time.  I’ve been looking into this stuff for Brie and her tattoos.”  “All good right now, though,” Brie said.  “I’m glad,” Avery said.  Jessica went on, saying, “The big issue is that by dividing it into quadrants and treating it as quadrants, you’re setting up individual legs, each with four spirits, that can be knocked down.  It would be better to distribute it more.  Help the spirits to get to know each other, by including them together in a night’s routine.  It’s better to do four, then offset.  Introduce some messiness and overlap, and keep tabs on the ones you’re neglecting as a result, maybe make the extra time or make it a once a day or once a week thing to swing by them and give them special attention.  Create weak points and turn them into strong points.”  “It is extra work,” Zed said.  “And what you’re doing isn’t wrong.”  “It’s simple but simple to beat, too.  If I did something like that during one of my trips to the deeper Ruins, waking up every hour to reinforce protections around my camp, I don’t think I’d be standing here.  I get the impression you want to protect this town.”  “We do,” Lucy said.  “Okay, yeah, alright.  That’s something we can do.”  “Introduce some clean salt to the ritual.  You can create a little furrow of salted ground between the shrines as you visit them.  You don’t want to use too much, don’t go killing trees, but… something for the echoes, while you’re looking after the spiritual side.”  “Perfect, that’s just the sort of advice we needed,” Lucy said.  “The kind of advice we’d probably have gotten from one of our culprits, if she hadn’t been keeping the outer barrier weak on purpose, maybe.”  “Do you guys want to take a shortcut?” Zed asked.  “My laptop’s running hot so I can pull it out and give us an escape route if we hear a motorcycle or if Witch Hunters show up, but… maybe we can use that to make a shortcut to where we’re going, and then I can give my laptop a rest?”  “Can the Witch Hunters get in there?” Brie asked.  “I don’t think so,” Verona told Brie.  She thought back to when she’d arranged this with Ken.  “They seemed pretty darn sure that you need the key.”  “Tell you what,” Zed said.  He pulled out the laptop, looked around, then sat on a lawn that was elevated above the sidewalk, with a short retaining wall of rough stone.  He put the laptop on his lap and began typing.  “I’ll set this up, you type in the address…”  Verona nodded.  “I think it’s goblins,” Avery said.  Snowdrop poked her head out of Avery’s bag, then made the little sneezing sound.  “So does Snowdrop.”  “When Biscuit was speaking through Jabber, she said she didn’t mean Kennet or Kennet’s people any harm,” Avery said.  “I remember that,” Zed replied.  “I wonder how much they’re just following orders, or if we’ve been misled by Cig.  Or does her pretending to be Jabber let her lie?  Can you be an actor and say your lines, even if they’re technically untrue?”  “I don’t think pretending to be Jabber lets her lie.  You can be an actor and say your lines, but the key parts of that are that you’d want to be an actor, first of all, and you’d want to avoid making any oaths.  Helps a hell of a lot if you pitch yourself to the spirits as an actor when you awaken.  Otherwise you’re probably going to gainsay yourself a ton before the spirits catch on to your rule of discourse.”  “Same with music and stuff?” Lucy asked.  “Same with music and stuff in that vein, yeah,” Zed told her.  “Helps if you develop a ritual.  Something you always do to get into character.”  “Clap your hands three times and spin in a circle on the spot, before the big ‘action!’?” Verona asked, smiling.  “Sure,” Zed said, fixated on his laptop.  “Or something slightly more normal.  I think we’re good to go.  I need an outlet to plug into…”  He typed something.  “Over there.”  They quickly walked to the end of the street, though technically Verona let the others do the quick walking, and then she caught up.  She grimaced and plucked at the back of her top, which was clinging to her, a bit clammy but not really helping with the heat.  She hated that she’d drawn the mental association between this and the idea that when this was all over she’d…  She glanced back over the river, in the direction of her dad’s house.  “Verona,” Lucy called out.  Verona hurried the last few steps.  As she approached, there was a doorway that looked like a bit of an optical illusion.  From a distance away, there was nothing, then a jumble of textured paint and steel.  All of that jumble came into alignment as a doorway as she approached.  It smelled like her dad’s old laptop had gotten, before he’d replaced it, buzzing and making the air smell sweet and thick in the nose.  “Coordinates?” Zed asked.  Verona leaned over, then typed the street intersection.  The old computer screen showed the general layout of the area, and placed a silhouette of a person down in the middle.  “Yep.”  Zed hit the key.  The door cracked ajar.  “Go.”  They went.  In through the door, down a passage of drywall and exposed wiring, floor unfinished, prepared like it was waiting for floorboards or tiles to be laid down.  The smell got worse as they got further into it.  The door on the far end was similar, though red.  Zed, first one to reach it, pushed it open and held it open.  “Thank you, sir,” Verona said, as they passed through.  She checked the bracelet, then hurried over to the street sign.  She put the key through the screw-hole for the bracket that kept the street signs rigid.  “Wait,” Jessica said.  Verona stopped.  “What sort of practice is that?”  “City magic?”  “Let Zed close up what he’s doing first,” Jessica said.  “Wait, what?” Zed asked, holding his laptop in one hand and typing with the other.  He looked over.  “Finish,” Jessica told him.  He did.  The door fell over, landing on a lawn.  The individual pieces and parts of the door weren’t there when Verona glanced over.  The smell was thicker in the air.  “What was that about?” Zed asked.  “It’s city magic,” Jessica said.  “Oh.  Yeah, huh,” Zed said, but his eyes were a bit wider.  “In case they didn’t tell you, don’t mix realm-type practices.  Any rituals or powerful items that open doors to the Warrens, don’t blend that with doors to the Ruins.  Or paths you make with technomancy.  Or Avery’s Lost stuff.  That’s 101 type Realm stuff, front of the books for beginners, in the Essentials text that any family dealing with that stuff would get when they come of age.”  Verona glanced at the others.  “…why?”  “Gets gnarly,” Zed said.  “Gnarly,” Lucy said, “That doesn’t explain a lot.”  “I’m trying to figure out how to put it gently,” Zed said.  “Don’t be gentle.  Not with this,” Jessica told him.  “Plicate spirits!” Verona exclaimed, snapping her fingers a few times.  “Messing with forces of an area and messing up the spirits?”  “Montague,” Avery said.  “Yeah, like…” Verona lost her momentum.  “Oh crap, like Montague.”  “I think you’re jumping straight from 101 to fourth year, special topics stuff,” Zed said.  “But yeah.  Horrors and derivative things.  That’s a good way to go from being a practitioner who’s trying to make a quick portal to Paris or wherever, to having your arms and legs broken as space folds around you.  If you’re lucky.”  “And if you’re unlucky?” Lucy asked.  “Being a broken creature stretched out across two realities at once, infused with aspects of both.  If you’re really unlucky, your Self or the spirits that drive you, uh, corrugate, at the same time.”  “Don’t do that to Zed,” Brie told them, stern.  “Right, okay.  Uh.  Super good to know.  I feel like the Blue Heron should have taught us that.” Verona replied, a little wide-eyed.  “I think they reinforce it at the start of every class, when they’re teaching students to open gates and portals.  This might be more of an issue of, uh, learning like you guys seem to have learned.”  “How’s that?” Avery asked.  “You’re learning lots of individual, little things from specific Others.  Maybe some of this is second nature to them, to the extent they think you should be able to feel or know some of this already.  But more likely, they don’t run into it because they work with a single discipline.  Lost stuff for your Lost Other, spirit stuff for Edith, Oni stuff for the… well, she’s more likely to be cross-discipline.  And they don’t open the big doorways or pathways in the way we do.”  “Right,” Verona said.  “So… is it a problem if I open this?”  “No.  My stuff’s done.”  “And is it a problem if we’re opening an Alcazar?  Or if we have Avery in there some time in the future and she opens a gate to some Path?”  “Shouldn’t be.  The big moments of weakness and stress on everything are when the doors are opened, a little less so when they’re closed.  Don’t open two doors at the same time, definitely don’t stand between them while you’re doing it, and practice extra good ritual hygiene and practices while you’re making a door.”  “Right,” Verona said.  She thought of the various times she’d made haphazard doors.  The Warrens, the door to the Ruins in the fight with Shellie…  “I’m good to do this?”  Zed nodded.  She put the key in.  “Roughly half the time it won’t do much more than screw up the ritual and scare the crap out of you,” Zed said.  “For the other half, well, half of those times it’ll go wrong, but wrong like being hit by a car and maybe things aren’t as straight or proportioned as they should be after.  But you can keep going down that rabbit hole of bad ends and half of the times you’re not that lucky, horror.  Then horror with a corrugated spirit, then a chance of being something that would make you wish you’d gotten off as easy as being a horror with a corrugated spirit.  And so on.”  “Right,” Verona said.  “Let’s not do that.”  She moved the sign.  The street adjusted, the scenery shifting.  Brie whistled.  “That’s a pretty big effect,” Zed said.  “Nice that it seems to operate on one hinge.  Less an opening, more of a single mechanism.  Probably want to play it safe, still, but I think chances of becoming a horror are pretty slim, just with this.”  “Right.  I don’t suppose you can weaponize that, huh?” Verona asked.  “The gate thing?”  “Would you want to weaponize it?” Jessica asked, her voice holding an odd tone.  “I’m just trying to get my head around what the practice is and what people out there are doing with it.”  “Right,” Jessica said.  “Could you?” Verona asked.  “I think someone out there probably has, with how humans work,” Zed said.  “But if they have I haven’t heard of them.  I don’t think most would want to.  Chance of getting caught in a fold is pretty steep, especially with the way karma and connections would probably make backlash very… backlashy.”  “You’re rambling a bit,” Jessica said.  “I love the ramble,” Verona said.  “Font of info.”  “I’ll stop,” Zed said, as the street clarified, settling in.  “Let’s focus.”  “Go in,” Verona said.  She withdrew the key, then jogged through, very aware of the space that was folding around her now.  Into the House on Half Street.  Verona opened the door, and they made their way into the hall.  Her alchemy setup was visible in the kitchen from the front hall.  And just off to the side…  Zed, Brie, and Jessica stopped in the doorway to look.  Zed spoke, tone of voice a bit different from before.  “You know the powers that be, judges, whatever, they’re the sort of entity a person on a big, universe-mandated quest would visit or meet with for a bit of an adjustment to their trajectory, four-fifths of the way into their journey or so?”  “Oh yeah?” Avery asked.  “Yeah.  Often the Alabaster, for guidance, but sometimes the Sable or some other deathly gatekeeper will bring them back for one last shot.  Sometimes a lady in gold to give them a treasure, equip them for the final confrontation or whatever.”  “And the Carmine?” Lucy asked.  “Kick their asses, knock them down a peg, maybe.  I dunno.  Maybe the Carmine’s meant to be the sort of thing that looks after the monsters, puts them in the right places for the quest?  Doesn’t get covered a lot in our books.”  Zed, Brie, and Jessica stood in the doorway, like they weren’t willing to approach the furs.  “Differs by area,” Jessica said.  “Not every place has the white, black, red, gold.”  “True,” Zed said.  “Point is… you three approached this world from the wildest angle.  You awoke in spring and you’re dealing with something that’s usually at the last part of a big story, what, two or three months in?”  “We met with those guys on day one,” Avery said, quiet.  Zed laughed, so sudden it kind of broke the spell for Brie and Jessica.  “I feel like I shouldn’t get too close,” Brie said.  “Trust those feelings,” Jessica said.  “You’ve got the murder weapon inside you,” Lucy said.  “And that’s the victim.”  “The Choir?” Jessica asked.  Lucy nodded.  Jessica crossed the length of the living room, and approached the cube.  She glanced back to check, then set a hand on the furs.  Furs stirred and moved in reaction, hairs pointing toward her.  She visibly shuddered, whole-body, and backed off.  “I’ll get started on the wards.”  “Okay, yeah, let’s get started on the boring part,” Zed declared.  “Complicated diagram.  You got chalk?”  “Yep,” Verona said.  “And I have a hard time seeing how this could be the boring part.  Learning new practice?”  “Given how interesting the rest of this is going to be?” Avery asked.  “Point,” Verona said.  “We’re meeting her, in a way, in the middle of a big universe-supported quest,” Lucy said.  “Maybe we’re four-fifths of the way along?”  “I hope not,” Verona replied.  “Because that’d mean a whole lot happens in the next eight days.”  🟂  The diagram was rigid, lots of straight lines, overlapping geometric shapes, and symbols at the intersections.  Verona sketched it out, and as she did, she was left with the distinct impression that this could be an artistic rendering of a church or some really fancy architecture, if drawn from above.  A circle for a round tower, lines for the walls, but inside it would be something of a mess.  Except for the vast open area that the furs occupied, sitting in the center, inside a two-dimensional cathedral, drawn out in chalk.  “How are the wards?” Zed asked.  “Trustworthy,” Jessica said.  “I might be diving into this to try to rescue them, right?  I won’t be worrying about the ward part of this when I dive in.”  “Let’s hope it doesn’t come to that,” Zed said.  “Brie?”  Brie put a hand on her shoulder and flexed it, drew in a deep breath, then sighed.  The Hungry Choir began to sing.  “I’ll keep them outside, and out of earshot,” Brie said.  “When we do this, it’ll be eleven minutes, but it might feel like longer, depending,” Zed said.  “So you’ll only be sitting outside on your own for three eleven minute intervals, alright babe?  Watch our backs, do what you can, let’s avoid a repeat of Jessica’s ritual at the Blue Heron.”  “Alright,” Brie said.  A child outside peered through the window, blood on her face.  “We’re intentionally avoiding twelve as a number,” Zed said, glancing at Verona, then Lucy, then Avery, before addressing them as a group.  “At eleven minutes, I’ll signal you.  If you really need an extra moment, extra question, we can stretch it out to eleven thirty.  But outside of that, we’re going full-on emergency mode.  That’s Jessica coming in, us pulling on connections, me shutting this down.”  “Thirty seconds of extra time?” Avery asked.  “Don’t joke around with this.  I’ll be pissed if you scare me by going over the time limit.  If I force the ritual to end while you’re in the middle of it, there’s a chance it messes you up, leaves you… very unstable, Self-wise.  But if we’re that far gone, and you’re not responding to signals or if you’re too caught up in the world inside these furs, we’re probably already in big problem territory.”  “With these things, it helps to punctuate them,” Jessica said.  “It doesn’t have to be time, if it’s very fluid in there.  It could be marking out eleven landmarks.  You don’t want to get to the twelfth.  Or eleven tolls of the town clock.”  “Keep in mind, if you actually go through eleven hours, it’s going to take you longer to get back into reality when you come back.  And we have dinner with your mom later,” Zed said.  Verona joined Lucy and Avery in nodding.  “Do you know what questions you want to ask?” Zed asked.  “Time periods or general scenes?”  “We talked about it,” Lucy said, glancing at Verona and Avery.  “We were thinking to start with, we need to know something more about this ritual that’s happening at the end of summer.  So we thought we’d cover that.  The very beginning, who she was, the taking of the throne.  It might give us some inklings about how they’d try to rope us in, and get one of us to potentially take the seat.”  “Okay,” Zed replied.  He reached over to his computer and made a note.  “This is more open-ended, but why her?” Avery asked.  “Why the Carmine, exactly?  And did the Carmine know?  Because she’s supposed to be aware of everything in her domain, right?”  “To an extent,” Jessica said.  “So we figure, moments she met the local Others, or moments she was aware of them.”  “That has the potential to get sloppy,” Zed replied.  “Or run out of time.”  “Can we start with the important stuff and then spiral out, and we leave on the signal?” Lucy asked.  Zed made a note, nodding once, but he didn’t look happy.  “And the end,” Verona said.  “Why didn’t she fight back?  What happened?  What are we missing?”  “That’s going to put you pretty close to something very violent and ugly,” Jessica said.  “Yeah, we talked about that,” Verona replied.  “But… it’s pretty important.”  “Who does which one?” Zed asked.  “We had ideas but we wanted to ask, any suggestions?  Are different scenes better for different members of our group?”  “I think it’s mostly about what you can do and what you can take.  That last one will be rough.”  “Arrivals and departures,” Avery said, quiet.  “Give me the first or the last.”  “I can do the last, if it’s tougher.  Hit me,” Verona said.  “I’d be worried,” Lucy said.  “I feel like you’re only just now getting fully okay again after, you know.  After you came to stay.”  “What happens if it’s too much?” Avery asked.  “It might bruise your Self, or diminish you.  You’d get swallowed up by the scene.  It’d be hard to pull you out.”  “I can’t pull you out, Ave,” Snowdrop said, from the background.  She’d been sleeping on the crappy furniture that had been left in the house.  “That’s possible,” Avery said.  “Isn’t it?”  “Yeah,” Zed said.  “That’d mean she isn’t in there with you.  But can you take it?  Watching something that rough?”  “I’ve seen bad stuff,” Avery said.  “Let me do it,” Verona insisted.  “If it’s bad then we’ll have Snow to pull me out.  I think I should,” Avery said.  “For reasons I don’t want to get into right away, I think I need to.”  “That’s… cryptic,” Verona said.  “Trust me?” Avery asked, eyebrows all the way up in the middle close together.  “I’m worried about Verona getting lost in tangents in the middle one,” Lucy said.  “I kinda really don’t like that we’re talking about me in terms of my weaknesses,” Verona said.  “It’s a bit of a running thing, you know.”  “You’re crazy good at practice, and you understand this stuff really well, you do really good spell notes,” Avery said.  “Go first.  Then give us tips?  Help explain it?”  “That’s better,” Verona said, still pouting a bit.  Still hurt a bit.  A bunch of unresolved stuff about Jeremy and family and feeling like the charity case stirred through her.  “Some people will do this naked, but I’m not going to suggest that,” Zed said.  “Uhh no,” Lucy replied.  “We weren’t for the awakening ritual either.”  “Should we don our cloaks and wizard hats?” Verona asked.  “We awoke in those.”  “For a major ritual?  For sure,” Zed replied.  Verona fished in her bag for what she needed.  The hat folded up nicely, and she had to unfold it.  She shook out her cloak.  Then she got her mask.  The three pieces of her mask.  “I regret including the witch hat,” Lucy said.  “Bit dorky.  We rarely wear it.”  “Excuse you,” Verona retorted.  “Dorkiness is a social construct.”  “What does that even mean?” Avery asked.  “Having regalia you keep for rituals is fine.  Maybe you’ll feel a bit silly as adults, but… I think living with your mess-ups as a kid is part of being older,” Zed said.  “You’re like, seventeen,” Verona told him.  “Who are you to talk about being older?”  “Do you guys need to do any prep?  Anything more you want to cover?” Jessica asked.  They shook their heads.  Lucy and Avery held their masks but didn’t wear them.  Hats and cloaks on.  “Verona, here,” Zed indicated a spot.  She walked over, and when Zed motioned, she sat.  “No phones or anything on you?”  Verona got her phone out of her pocket, put it on the floor, and pushed it Lucy’s way, then did the same for spell cards, glamour from the flower, one of the knives, her keys, and wallet.  Lucy collected it and put it all aside.  She adjusted her cape and hat, three pieces of her mask in her lap, and looked up at Zed, then flinched because Zed was bending down beside her.  She watched as he used a tool to draw a circle around her where she sat.  He drew a two-foot wide path between her and the diagram.  “I’m going to pour clear water over you, to cleanse you and this entry-space.  It’ll be cold but put up with it.”  She nodded, hat shifting.  It wasn’t all that cold.  It was warm out and the water had cooled to nearly room temperature.  But it was a shock.  She tried to take it as refreshing.  The water that poured down didn’t pass the chalk, instead filtering through the floorboards.  “Power to the diagram…” Zed said, absently.  The computer kicked in.  Machines hummed.  Smaller parts of the ‘cathedral’ diagram began to lift up off the floor.  The furs stirred.  “Anything you guys can do to help this along saves me some trouble,” Zed said.  “Ray’s been too busy with Charles to really communicate with me, and I get the sense he doesn’t want to get too involved so he can stay impartial, but I’d rather not have to explain too huge a power deficit.”  Lucy knelt by Verona, Avery taking the opposite side.  Both put fingers to the very edge of the chalk.  “For Kennet,” Avery said.  “So we can finish the duties we’ve been asked to undertake,” Lucy added.  “Open the way,” Verona breathed, looking forward.  That kickstarted it.  Bigger pieces of the diagram lifted up, and as they did, the furs shifted and changed position.  Light played on light, shadow on shadow, and the floor vibrated enough that specks of dirt and sand were kicked up.  Verona could have swiped a hand beneath some with the height they got.  Fans on computers redoubled their efforts, roaring like little jet engines…  And the furs sighed.  Tense, Verona held her position.  Like something alive, the furs moved, lengths of them extending like legs planted on the ground, pushing the body to its full height.  The furs lunged up, the ceiling parted, the sky became visible, and it was as red as anything Verona had ever seen, in multiple shades.  The edifice in front of her wasn’t furry or furred, but it had the same coppery-red gleam.  Damaged, it was shored up by ropes that shouldn’t have supported some of the structures that were there.  “The countdown starts from the moment you enter.”  Zed’s voice sounded far away.  “Announce your intent on entering, with authority.”  “Pick your battles, on what you want to fight or change,” Jessica intoned, voice coming from nowhere in particular.  “You’re primarily a spectator,” Zed added.  She put a hand on the ground and it was slick with blood.  All of it was, as far as she could see- which wasn’t too far.  The edifice took up the entire space in front of her, and trees stood on either side of the two-foot wide path before her.  Blood, thick as anything, covered her legs and arm, from where she’d been sitting.  The ground was tacky with the thick blood beneath her shoes as she walked.  Wind whipped around her, blowing the ends of her hair into her face.  Trees rasped.  The door was wood, and it resembled the floorboards of the house.  Recognizing that point of structure and similarity made it easier to make sense of this world.  She pushed the door open, and there was only darkness inside, hot like a wolf’s breath in her face.  It smelled like meat and it stirred feelings deep in her stomach and brain both, where her headaches and stomachaches tended to dwell.  “Take me to the beginning, show me when she took the throne!” Verona shouted into the darkness.  Liquid, thinner than blood, welled out of the dark space, washing over her blood-soaked shoes, over legs.  It touched bare feet that were no longer feet.  Water as black as anything washed over her legs.  The traction beneath her failed her, the ground was slimy, the surface uneven.  She was dragged by that small tow, at the same moment it intensified.  Water washed over her, practically pulling her into the dark.  Underwater, trying to find her bearings, the smell of a meat-eater’s breath thick in her nostrils and mouth, she floundered, fingers and claws dragging against rock.  She found a flat patch, the rocks still slick with slime beneath the running river, her claws digging in, and then she stood, back arching to thrust belly and chest out, eyes widening in a way that opened them past where her usual eyelids would have had to stop.  Joints popped as she stretched out her limbs, femurs grinding against pelvis.  The meat-eater’s breath was her own.  Her jaw cracked as she opened it wide, and fangs clacked together as she slammed it shut.  She looked out at forest and river, grass and nearby hills, dusted gray with snow.  I’m her.  “Don’t get swallowed, Verona.”  Zed.  I’m Verona.  “Hurry up, you’re so slow!” Lucy shouted.  She was Verona.  She was slow.  Running down the streets of Kennet, hair long.  Lucy just ahead of her, hair looser, longer, bouncing with running steps.  They carried stupid crummy plastic ball-throwing toys that would break after a few days of play.  Verona’s wrist was scraped a bit by a piece of wood she’d had in her pocket as her arm rubbed past it.  A section of tree trunk, where branch had met knot, that had been sitting just underwater.  Pulled from the log, it came away shaped like a retro ray gun, edges smoothed down, streamlined, the ‘barrel’ drawn to a swooping point.  Later on, after it was dry, she’d paint it.  She’d do a bad job and get discouraged, but it would sit on the back of her art shelf.  Until her dad shoved everything off the shelf in a fit of pique.  That was for later.  The sky was somehow bigger, the town massive, the no-go zones imposed by parents tantalizing, waiting for her in the future, like the north end of downtown and the factories at the southeast end.  Focus.  This isn’t what I’m meant to be seeing.  I don’t know why I’m seeing this.  She was the Carmine Beast before it was Carmine.  She ran through woods, nose close to the ground, smelling the world in a thousand flavors, hearing the sound of it, each sound an adventure.  She could the feel of the earth through her paws, in her paws.  The river was there.  She was dimly aware of it.  Steering this, driving it toward where she needed it to be, it was hard.  She couldn’t get out of the river.  If she followed it, waited to pick her battles, then she was running, almost always with one paw in contact with the soil, feeling that thud far away.  Something big.  A man on horseback.  She lunged from the woods, just in front of the rider, from trees to trees, her paws barely touching the path itself.  She leaped from one point of river to another, hurdling a rock that she might otherwise have slid into.  The horse reared up, eyes wild, and threw its rider.  The man fell, the bags he’d been riding with spilling over.  “You’re so good at this,” Brooklyn said, leaning over.  Her head turned.  She was in class.  Her artwork was picked up by her teacher, which annoyed her because it wasn’t done.  It was a cat, drawn with only tight zig-zags, each one carefully arranged to suggest shape.  No nose, no mouth, just very big eyes.  “Very nice,” the teacher said.  Focus.  She was the Beast, and she moved through the woods, aware of the attention she got.  The fear, the respect, the amusement from goblin things.  She moved naturally, following a course she couldn’t pull away from, a train on its rails, but she was fur, paw, and something vulpine.  I need to get on track, I need to find a middle ground.  So I can steer without retreating into myself or falling into the Beast.  She navigated the river.  She had paws, but they were black-furred.  Claws, but they were retractable.  Her body was dressed in shadow, not fur, lithe and graceful.  She could move on all fours and she could move on her back legs.  A Cat-Beast Verona, a middle ground between the Carmine and her.  Easier to manage.  She couldn’t leave the river.  The landscape wouldn’t let her  Forks of the river showed themselves, and she took those courses, running between concrete edifices.  Buildings with strange, unscaleable rooftops, with canals running between them, in various sizes and shapes.  She created her art, spirits and cats dancing around her, but many of them were more of an extension of what she was, a creative spin on her own shadow, than anything of its own.  She picked up a cat and threw it into the wall, and it turned into images, sprawling, intense graffiti.  Doing harm, yes, but in a way that was needed.  Bringing something to a stale place.  Spirits stirred, showing interest, more cats appeared, peering down and around, and she painted the area black and red, eyes wide on a face without a nose or mouth.  She was agile, she loved moving, she created, and she loved that too.  “You need to focus.”  Her mom leaned over her.  She’d taken some of the materials in front of her, and started drawing, homework left aside.  Her mom took the work in progress away.  “We’ve been at this homework for hours, Verona,” her mom said.  “This isn’t meant to take this long.”  “I want to draw.”  “But you need to do this work-”  Materials from ongoing construction in this concrete canal city made navigating the river hard.  Pipes and bits of concrete threatened to stab her if she wasn’t careful with her movements.  She leaped up, scrambling to scale a rooftop and find a bit of flat ground.  A balcony sticking out the side of a building.  The concrete edifices were growing, being built up, cranes throwing up more walls, throwing down more debris.  She saw people crossing a bridge, took a running start, and she leaped.  She took three different forms in the air, before landing in an explosion of cat and shadow, fur and snarl.  Scaring them.  A couple, they scrambled away, jumping from the bridge, ten or twelve feet to the water below.  They were faced with the debris, the mess, the ruin.  One was even hurt and the smell of that hurt filled her nose, mingled with the taste of meat she’d eaten a day ago, still heavy on her breath.  She had no mouth until her lips parted into a wide, fanged smile.  Back to the woods.  There were noises and cheers, and spirits stirred around her, giving her life.  She smelled a male and he was willing, and she pounced on him.  “You have so much potential, Verona,” the teacher said.  Parents and teacher together, addressing her on a parent teacher night.  “You need to apply yourself,” her father said.  She felt bad and she couldn’t articulate how things had come to this, how she’d failed when apparently she was supposed to do so much better.  Her teacher was a jerk and that was a failure but that never got addressed and it wasn’t fair.  Tearing up, she pushed her chair back, standing, and fled, running into the hall where she could cry on her own.  Except people were there.  She headed for the bathroom.  Her parents followed.  Her father stopped at the door while she pushed her way in.  She pushed her way past the flimsy doors and fences.  Into this place where the building was happening.  She terrified the people working, saw one challenge her, and she snarled a dangerous sort of cat snarl, hair all over her standing on end like needles, waiting to see if they weren’t afraid.  The fear was the point.  They weren’t afraid enough, so she stepped in, past the pipe they were using as an improvised cudgel, and made like she was going to kiss the side of the man’s neck.  The taste of blood exploded into her mouth as the blood did, jugular neatly severed.  She made a spectacle of it, clawed fingertips digging into the wound, pulling it open wide, letting the blood spray onto the plain concrete walls beside her.  Cats danced and she bid them to jump onto the scene, a wholesale mural mingling with blood.  Black and red.  People fled and people ran.  She tore through heavy machinery, she demolished the delicate, she toppled the neatly stacked, she threw everything into disarray.  She raged and she couldn’t put words to that rage.  Water welled and began to flow as she knocked down retaining walls, the river flowing and painting the path for her.  She took this little construction project apart until there was no way it could resume, then she fled, before men with other weapons could arrive.  Over rooftop, into canal, gliding on ink that flowed like river.  Through building, and out again.  New obstacles- grates, gates, levers, fences.  She reached the settlement’s edge, returned to where the canals became rivers again, the forest beside her.  She expected the amusement, the applause, the rallying around her.  Even fear and respect.  There was silence.  The trees had thinned out, and spirits had too.  Even here, there were signs of civilization.  Signs bolted to trees that the spirits obeyed.  She looked back, and she was stunned-  Already, they were resuming the build, cleaning up the damage.  And while she’d been working on that, the horizon had changed.  More settlements springing up, more construction projects.  Projects that had started when she entered had become concrete cubes and towers in the meantime.  As the Beast, she could see the palisades, the logs with rope lashing them together, some torn, some in ruins, but people hurried to rebuild.  She slipped into being Verona again.  “Do you ever feel like a last minute addition?”  “Huh?” Lucy asked.  “To the world.  Like, here are the leftovers, it’s going to make a weird human, but we’ll just jam her in there, here are two people we’ll pair them up, they can be her parents.  But every step of the way, you’re not supposed to be here, there’s one person too many, ugh, this upsets the existing plans, this should be simple and easy and now it’s a mess?”  “You are messy.”  “But really,” Verona said.  “Like you don’t fit in with family, like you don’t fit in at school, and you’re meant to do all these things and the world doesn’t let you?”  “I dunno.  Do you feel that way with me?”  “Maybe.  Maybe like we’re a happy accident, like oops, these two humans got stuck together.”  Lucy grabbed Verona’s arm, tight,  “Don’t pull us apart!”  Verona let Lucy tug on her arm, making her rock side to side.  “My mom left.”  The lump in her throat grew.  “My mom told me,” Lucy said.  “I wasn’t sure how to bring it up.”  “My parents are separating, they might split for good.  And that feeling like there’s no place for me is so, so much worse right now,” Verona whispered.  As the Beast, she sat on a ridge, and it felt like every time she blinked her eyes, the world was changing.  A light flickered, the very first gas streetlight igniting in Montreal.  She was joined by many others, but she didn’t belong to them.  They didn’t cheer her.  They only marked the occasion.  The smarter among them recognized her for what she was and pitied her.  No place for a beast to remind people about the dark anymore.  She ran as the Beast, finding the river that wasn’t a river.  She ran as Verona the Cat Beast, trying to find her course.  A limited number of routes she could take, less forks, less branches.  “You need to focus on your education, or you can’t get into University,” her dad said.  “Do I even want to go to University?”  “I’d hope you do.  If you ever want to get a job-”  She looked at him, uncomprehending.  “You have to get a job.  No guy is going to want to marry a mooch.”  “They might if I’m cute enough.”  “You are cute,” her father said, smoothing her hair down.  “But being cute and smart is better, and when you stop being cute-”  “Plastic surgery?”  “-being smart will be what counts.”  Less forks, less branches, a treacherous path.  As Verona the Cat Beast, she ran, testing the fringes of civilization, but every time she turned, cat-shadows dancing around her.  She drew when she could, but the time grew increasingly fleeting, the effects smaller.  “You’re a candidate.”  She paused, looking up.  The Carcass in Sable stood on the rooftop, flesh alternately exquisite in beauty and in rotting tatters, wearing a black dress.  “For the Carmine Throne.  A place for you to be.  Give it some time.  Consider.”  As the Beast, standing in the woods.  “Nothing I do matters,” Verona groaned.  “I get the same grades no matter what I do, whether I study or not.”  “There’s no way that’s true,” her mother told her.  Sixteen year old Verona groaned again, exaggerated.  The television was on in the background- “…employment rates are down, even having a bachelor’s isn’t sufficient anymore.  There’s less opportunities even for the educated, housing prices are skyrocketing out of control, food prices are on the rise…”  “It feels like none of this matters,” Verona told her mom.  “This?  Getting this education?  This is how you get to a place where what you do can matter.  Take this opportunity.  Not everyone gets one.”  Verona swallowed.  “Pass these exams, get good final grades for your last semester, go to University, get a good degree, get a job, find someone to marry, buy a house, have kids, worry about money, get divorced, worry more about money, find someone else, have more kids, raise them, worry about them, get old, scrape by in your retirement, die.”  “I’m not sure I want to ever get married.”  “You’ll change your mind,” her mom said, absently, while sorting through mail.  “I’m not sure I want to bring kids into this world.”  “You will, just wait.  You have a letter from Lucy.”  Verona took it and opened it.  A birthday card.  She wasn’t sure what she was expecting, and when the disappointment seized her like a big robot hand around her neck, it wasn’t because the message inside wasn’t sweet and heartfelt.  One message in the last year.  Two from Avery, but Avery was even further away.  “Isn’t that sweet?” her mom kissed the top of her head.  “You should write back.”  Some of the messages back had gone unanswered.  This is the Carmine’s version of events, mapped to me, it’s not-  “But first,” her mother interrupted the thought.  “Study.  Exams, get good grades, go to a good University, get a degree-”  “Degrees count for less,” the television declared.  “I know, Mom.”  “-get a job-”  “Unemployment rates are skyrocketing.”  “-find someone to marry, buy a house-”  “Housing prices are increasingly unaffordable for the younger generations-“  Verona got up from the seat, away from that, away from her mom, the television, the study materials, the letter.  “What else are you going to do, Verona?  It’s your only option!” her mom called out after her.  She stepped out onto the balcony.  The card had left her more heartsick than anything else.  What else am I going to do?  She was back in Kennet, a decaying, sad, lonely little town.  Behind the fast food place where Melissa worked part-time.  Melissa flicked the lighter-  No.  “These wrongs are coming in your lifetimes.  And I damn the lot of you to it!” Bristow’s voice shouted from the void between Verona’s older self and the Cat Beast version of her.  Hairs standing on end with goosebumps up her entire body, Cat Beast Verona stepped out onto a cliff’s edge, looking out over the distance at the sprawl of plain, uninteresting concrete.  Lonely.  The last spirits she felt any kinship to had moved on.  Her shadow had no cats in it.  She was diminished.  She wasn’t sure where she was supposed to be or what she was meant to do.  The world seemed too large.  Anything she did would be scrubbed away.  No impact to be made.  This is how you make your impact.  “Okay,” she said.  “I’ll tell the others.  You have our support,” the Alabaster told her, from a seat high above.  As the Beast that predated Verona by hundreds of years, she prowled her way forward.  A man covered in wounds sat naked on the throne.  He stared at her, his gaze level.  He was retiring, she knew.  Partially out of expectations.  Partially because he was done.  He was tired, and it was clear in the gaze and the way he sat, even though he was strong, blood-slick, deep brown skin stretched over taut muscle.  She padded her way forward.  He didn’t move or take his eyes off of her.  She had a sense that in this circumstance, if she had to fight him, she’d lose.  But there was no fight in him.  She took his head in her jaws, forcing him to lean forward, and she bit deep enough that bone crunched and severed.  She tore, one paw in his lap, pulling meat free, she ate, chewing, swallowing, taking some of that power, and then she howled.  Declaration made.  In other versions of events, her mother egged her on, urged her about midterms, finals, grades.  Moving out was too expensive so she stayed at home for a while.  She sent out envelopes, handed them in at desks.  The fight had begun already- midterms, finals, job search-  Teeth in a human’s throat, biting in deep, past practice-wrought protections.  In some small, hollow way, she wasn’t sure if the fact she was going through the motions and the fact she didn’t care about the outcome was giving her an edge.  A man who took too deep a wound to his arm looked down at the damage, and she knew from years of experience as the teeth in the dark that made people afraid of the woods, that was a fear of capabilities being taken away at a critical moment.  He rallied, reached for a weapon, but that small delay had bought her the opportunity to bite deep before his axe could meet her side.  The battlefield was hers.  It moved under her feet like she wanted, and in a way, she already sat on the throne.  It wasn’t a flat surface, but a ground that tilted metaphysically in ways she needed it to tilt, because of three figures who stood by watching.  The Alabaster Doe, the Carcass in Sable, and the Gold-Furred Mouse.  They expected her to take the role, that expectation had power in itself.  Focus.  We wanted to learn-  She tracked the other challengers who waited, judged them.  The practitioner tried to bind her, and the Judges overseeing this process disallowed it.  This was to be about combat, not entrapment.  She was close enough to the throne to have a sense of how this worked.  To know that the rules were different each time, as much as they could get away with.  Most contests were spaced so far apart, unmonitored by those who weren’t judges or participants, that the rules could be changed, adjusted.  Being chosen by the Judges gave that little advantage.  They wanted someone they could work with.  And they’d chosen her.  She killed the practitioner, as he reached for other tools and practices, and she shook him violently.  She was as powerful as she’d ever been, and it was a power derived from being on the brink, the potential…  As Verona, she put the phone down.  “Well?” her mom asked.  “I guess I got an apartment.”  She felt okay about it.  Her mom seemed happier about it than she was, which, of course, given she was still at home at twenty-two.  She could almost get a sense of what she was meant to be feeling, like she was on the brink of-  Of success?  Of taking the role?  As the Cat Verona, she tore out throats with claws.  She painted pictures of teeth and claws on the pavement and walls, and she gave them life.  She ripped, tore, fought-  A group of goblins, bound together into a cohort, they wanted to hold the throne together as a quartet.  She reduced them to a trio.  Then a pair.  Her bloody shadows crept across the arena, formed open jaws, and  swallowed the last one whole, as he used his vulgar parts to help make an even more vulgar gesture.  A bogeyman, Verona knew what to call it, even though the Beast didn’t.  He was one who cast others into the Abyss.  The floor was fragile around him, the barriers between here and that dark place thin enough that one firm kick or toss of his opponent would send his victim through, for a long fall.  He was a powerful breed, once a Scourge, he’d gone down with his demesne and he’d come back angry, that space a tool he could use and shape.  The Judges tried to push back, because this was an arena for fighting, victory by combat, not by banishment, but he knew better.  He changed the space to be pit with walls and floor festooned with spikes and blades.  They allowed the combat to happen like that.  He had the right, even if they had the ability to put a toe on the scales.  She cut the bogeyman, nipped at him with shadows.  She blocked his way, frustrated him, fed that anger that made him so unsuitable to the role.  He changed his pit once again, as she fought him, because he wanted to be meaner than spikes and blades, and the Judges acted, barring that option.  Verona the Cat Beast crashed through the barrier with the bogeyman, biting, clawing, slashing, and he didn’t react much to the pain-  But the landing, a solid bottom to the pit, no spikes, he was beneath her, and the jarring landing helped her to drive claw points and teeth deep enough to matter.  She tore as she rose to her feet, and brought enough of his throat and heart with her that he didn’t get back up.  There were more, but she was less and less worried.  She should have been tired, but she was presently the closest to the throne.  She could drink of its power now.  She could use it.  She healed, scaled the wall of the pit, and let the next challenger come.  Another beast, a bear twice the usual size, with a man’s spirit and mind inside it.  It was weaker than the others.  The most important challengers had come first.  The ones who followed were ones who couldn’t turn down a fight, because of what they were, or because of stupidity.  Fewer and fewer of them had power.  A sea of slaughter.  A sacrificial rite, killing all comers, to take the seat.  Each defeat drenched the ground in blood and with her having the advantage, that power flowed to her.  “Any more?” the Carcass in Sable asked.  There was silence.  Blood had reached branches overhead and now it oozed and dripped down.  Blood on the new Carmine Beast’s snout dripped down as well.  A tongue licked some of it away.  The Carmine Cat licked from elbow to hand, cleaning.  She licked again, tongue moving through the shadows she was dressed in, now red.  She looked at the throne.  Wounded, hurting, the Carmine Beast loped over.  Wounded, hurting, the Carmine Cat limped over.  She pushed open the door to her house, chased by the worries of the day, the responsibilities of being a manager.  She kicked off shoes, then walked down the length of the hallway, wincing with the soreness of being older, facing the accumulated aches of a long day of sitting.  To be followed by a long night of sitting.  She settled on the bed,  The Carmine Beast sat in the throne, adopting a human form.  The metaphorical river stretched out ahead of her.  The Carmine Cat seated herself, curling legs up beside her.  There were no branches or forks in the way forward.  This was it.  She didn’t turn on the television, sitting in her bed.  Her expression, distorted from a bit of weight gain, was there, pale, in the reflection on the screen, lips pulled down by cheeks, outer edges of her eyes pulled down in a similar fashion.  An expression of perpetual sadness, highlighted by the contrast of being reflected in the black screen.  “Even winning feels like losing,” all three of them said, in unison.  The Carmine Beast’s thoughts, given voice.  “When it’s by the rules of that world.”  Outside the window of her bedroom, kids ran down the street.  One shouted, “Hurry up, you’re so slow!”  The Carmine Cat dreamed of being an ink-black cat, painting the walls, free, wild-  The Carmine Beast remembered old hunts and slipped into a doze.  The work would begin later.  Zed’s voice was distorted, as if through a bad sound system.  “You’re about five and a half minutes in.  This marks the halfway point, Verona.”  Halfway.  She looked at her middle-aged face in the television screen.  She could push this further, but she was certain that if she did, it would consume her.  Not because the Carmine influence was so strong, but because the versions of her would be more and more diminished.  She stood, stretching, joints popping in all three forms.  Then she stepped aside from the single course that lay ahead of her.  🟂  “It’s easier if you pick a path and commit to it,” Zed explained.  Verona smiled to herself at the irony of it.  She felt very, very tired.  She’d just finished recounting the broad strokes.  “So the fight is rigged?” Lucy asked.  “No, not exactly,” Verona replied.  “It’s… more like they pick someone who has their favor, and the contest is skewed to bias those who have their favor.  Most don’t see enough consecutive Carmine throne contests to really say anything about it.”  “There’s a bit of a quantum physics angle to this,” Zed said.  “That’s maybe wayyyy over my head, buddy,” Verona said, smiling a bit.  “When you observe something, you change the outcome.  If you’ve seen that and you know that, you reserve the ability to call them out, it ties their hands?  Like jury nullification, it’s… even knowing is pretty potent.”  “Way over my head again,” Verona told him.  “Good if it’s anyone but John, but if it is John…” Lucy trailed off.  “We want him to have the advantage.”  “Yeah,” Verona replied.  “Are you okay, Ronnie?” Avery asked.  “Everything intact, not too shaken?  You seem quieter.”  “Just… very close to where it hurts, somehow,” Verona replied.  “I think on purpose.  It’s like the furs wanted to paint a picture that really helped me get it.  So it used my life.  And I’m getting really tired of the universe telling me there’s no future, while it takes my options away.”  “I don’t get it,” Lucy told her.  “I think I’m not necessarily that enthusiastic about becoming Other,” Verona said, smiling a bit.  “That’s admittedly a bit of a relief,” Lucy told her.  She felt a weird kind of anxiety at that.  Frustration.  It mingled with other feelings.  But what if you aren’t around?  She wanted to ask.  But Zed and Jessica and Brie and Avery were here and she didn’t- she didn’t want to be like her dad, and be all plaintive, dwelling in the worst case.  She knew what Lucy would say and it didn’t change the feeling.  She wasn’t that enthusiastic about being human either, and it felt like the courses and forks ahead of her were being taken away.  Gotta figure out what the heck I’m doing, then, Verona thought.  She picked herself up.  She was still wet from the river water Zed had used to clean her, though she wasn’t dripping anymore.  She used fingernails to adjust wet hair and get everything where it should be.  “There was nobody like us,” Verona told them.  “Hm?” Lucy asked.  “We talked about it.  What Charles said.  There was nobody like us.  I could see how Charles might describe it or paint the picture of what this event might look like, but seeing the people who decided to fight for the throne… you’re the most capable in a fight, Lucy, and there’s no way you’d… even angry, I don’t think you’d step into that arena.”  “You think Charles was lying?”  Verona nodded.  “We thought it was possible,” Avery said.  “Yeah,” Verona said.  “It’s a place for those who are willing to wade through blood to get to the throne.  That’s not us.”  “Okay,” Lucy said.  “That… that might help John, then, right?  We know the Judges set the little rules for the contest…”  “Very carefully picking the rules that determine what’s suitable for a trial for the Carmine Throne…” Verona said, trailing off.  “And if we know that, if we know John’s fighting, we can stay clear, keep the coast clear.  If we know someone else is somehow going to get that favor…”  “Or be closer to the throne,” Verona added.  “And we know Charles lied,” Avery said, sounding upset and looking frustrated.  “And we should work out why.  Misdirection?”  “Could be,” Lucy said.  “Okay,” Zed said.  “Let’s, uh, get water, eat a bite, I want to make sure Brie isn’t too anxious sitting out there alone, use the washroom-”  “Facilities work,” Verona said, pointing up.  “Fantastic.  And then we’ll douse you in water, I guess, Lucy.”  “I’ve got a lot of ground to cover, but it sounds like time moves slower there?”  “Might’ve been my approach,” Verona replied.  “Okay,” Lucy said.  “This is… it has me optimistic, for the first time in a bit.  There’s-”  “Be careful,” Verona interrupted her.  “I don’t think she’s very happy.  That taste I got of the future?  Rough.”  “I think it was painting a picture for you,” Avery said.  “Hmmm, of the closest thing it could find to a thing in your life or your imagination, to an option-less future.  There’s almost always options, right?”  “Right,” Verona replied.  “Even if you got that far, you could pick up painting, you could exercise, you could change things up.  Your dad- that was a lot like your dad, from what you describe.  He has those options too.”  “I don’t think he can see them.”  “Which is why I’ll be there,” Lucy said.  “I’ll smack you upside the back of the head if I have to.  I’m not going anywhere, you tit.”  Verona smiled.  “I’m going to make sure Snowdrop hasn’t eaten all the snacks,” Avery said, turning away and stretching, one hand straight up, other at her elbow.  “Good call,” Lucy said.  “Let’s get centered, figure out what’s up.”  “Be careful,” Verona said again.  “Okay?  Be careful in there?”  “I’ll try,” Lucy said.  “Can I ask?” Zed turned to Verona, as Lucy left the room.  “How’s your Sight?”  Verona blinked, turned on her Sight, and she looked.  She was a bit surprised.  “Less gainsaid than before.”  “It was us doing the practicing, me primarily, for the Alcazar, but you did the journey.  For the sake of oaths you swore.  Counts.”  “Good to know,” Verona replied.  “I was convinced you’d be in there for the full eleven, maybe twelve minutes.  I’m glad you weren’t.”  They were so optimistic, glad to be figuring things out, glad the ritual had worked.  She looked at Lucy’s back as Lucy chugged water, and prepared to be doused in river water.  She stared at her friend’s back, wishing she could convey what she needed to convey.  But words failed her.  What would Lucy see?  They wanted Lucy to see who the conspirators were, and verify if the Carmine Beast had actually helped create the Choir.  But what else?  If this whole ritual thing tapped into them, as much as it tapped into the historical events, to convey things with their full gravity, what would Lucy get hit with?  What would Avery see, if she was the one to witness the death?  They hoped she’d see some explanation as to why the Carmine hadn’t fought back.  Some explanation as to why she walked to the middle of town.  It wasn’t angry.  It wasn’t even that it was sad.  For Verona, she’d seen a lot, and what she’d seen had been hard to grapple with.  She didn’t want Lucy to deal with that kind of hardness.  She didn’t want Avery to.  Especially when they had tougher tasks ahead of them.  Reaching further, facing a death.  That was hard to shake.  Even if she objectively knew Avery was right, yeah, obviously there were more options than she’d felt like.  Yeah, she could trust Lucy to stick around, even if both an special Alpeana-branded nightmare and an Alcazar had portrayed futures where they’d been separated by some events in the past.  She’d tried to warn Lucy, but she couldn’t articulate it further without possibly injecting anxieties into Lucy’s head that would taint the scenes she saw.  Avery looked at her, and Avery looked lonely, somehow, in a way that it had felt, being the Carmine.  One week and one day, she thought.  I’d call this off if I didn’t think we needed the answers and details to get through to the other side.

      "               <Document: {'content': '    Lucy kept her eyes mostly closed as Zed poured the water over her, peering through lashes with her gaze on the furs.  With her Sight on, she could track the movement and expansion of the lines through her eyelids.  They rose up around her, extended, and added perspectives that hadn’t been there before, folding and unfolding the furs themselves.  A citadel of coppery red material, bound together with red cordage, with dark trees on either side.  She opened her eyes wider.  The environment kissed her body, shadows extending to meet her as if they were her shadows, branches touching the side of her head and leaving crimson behind, blood?  Not blood.  Her skin turned blacker than moonless midnight, her eyes a neon red that cast its own light, an effect that touched and ran through her hair.  Her limbs grew longer, as did neck and back.  Her heart grew heavy in her chest, until she was left feeling like whatever was holding it in place wasn’t necessarily strong enough to secure it.  Touching the door broke the last bits of unaltered Lucy, letting them fall to the shadow beneath her feet.  Violent wind whipped around her and pulled her hair free of its ties, and it didn’t hold its prior shape.  It held the shape of hair that had been left unbound and touched largely by wind, not anything else.  “Actions and associates, particularly those pertaining to Kennet,” she murmured.  Zed had said to be firm, but with the feeling in her chest, this felt like the right tone for entering.  She pushed, and a door twenty feet tall broke and crashed open, as if a train had run into it.  At the same time, the doorway itself rushed in the opposite direction, as fast as that train might go.  The darkness beyond swept past her.  It lingered, and she realized her eyes were closed.  She’d been sleeping.  She stretched out on her throne, one leg hooked over the arm, her back and one arm draped over the other arm, one bare foot in the blood red soil.  She could feel it simmering, boiling, broiling with activity.  “Do you want any counsel, madam?”  She rolled her head to one side, and she looked at the small mouse with golden fur perched on a rock.  She considered eating it, but then she saw the very large, twisting shadow it cast.  It was too big to get her mouth around, in ways that had nothing to do with size.  “If I may make a suggestion, you could pick out lieutenants, or create them from nothing.  Soldiers to run your errands, keep your company…”  She met those small black eyes with her own neon red ones.  “No?  It remains an option, miss Carmine. As you no doubt see, the spirits will handle most things, but things too contentious to manage will-”  She moved her hand, fingers flicking out in the mouse’s direction.  It bounded off, disappearing into foliage.  Trees swayed with its passage.  Toes dug into dirt.  Her awareness dug into the world around her, up until it butted up into other territories.  She was aware of conflicts big and small, fighting, killing, predators hunting prey and brother killing brother, husband killing wife, child harming child.  She was aware of the fornication, of the intimidation, of posturing, positioning, of power itself.  The more she dwelt on the details, the more time slowed down, giving her the space to do so.  It would take a personality different from her own to face every individual issue.  The throne moved as she wished it to move, taking a form she wished it to take.  She formed it into something more comfortable, then found herself vaguely dissatisfied.  It was too easy, a comfort without the earning of that comfort.  She let it remain uncomfortable, fit for a figure slightly different from her own, the previous holder.  Sitting there, draped across an uncomfortable seat, toes in the dirt, she held her court as a Queen might, but instead of attendants guiding the common folk and nobles to her audience, the universe served up the things too difficult for the spirits to make firm decisions on.  She could have left it be, let them sort it out with their own judgment, but in the doing, it would be the loudest, the most established, and the strongest who would win in all things.  She still licked wounds from recent decades, watching Man establish.  Watching Man grow in strength.  Watching Man win by its own strength.  Even now, Man brought slaves here.  Invaders conquered, fought, and exchanged bitter plague and sickness with those people who had been here since before she had manifested, well before she had taken this throne.  Goblins of the European countries met and mingled with the little people of the wilderness here, as did a grouping of dwarves.  The ferocious mingled with goblins, and the canny mingled with dwarves.  Another sort of establishment.  A group of those newcomers who had made binding deals to be able to speak with spirits, ghosts, and other forces were meeting, to negotiate the ways forward, agreeing to put old enmities to rest.  Others fought in subtle ways, hoping to remove potential rivals and rivals from half a world away before those people could establish themselves.  With so many sick, in unfamiliar territory, or weary from trying to forge a way forward, the hopes were warranted more often than not.  She did not leave it be.  She would adjudicate.  1.  Edward Lehman met with Henrietta Belton on the shores of one of the great lakes.  Edward had been searching for soapstone, guided by a spirit companion he had summoned, and Henrietta Belton lived in the region, a regular hedge witch who was trying to figure out what herbs were in the area.  Their initial meeting scared one another, and moments of fear can, if followed by security, help open the heart to infatuation.  Edward, seventeen, son of a great practitioner family, helps provide that security by being helpful.  Henrietta, twelve, accidentally found her way into practice alongside a group of ‘sisters’, fellow students at a house for wayward girls and orphans, before being adopted.  One of her last gifts before her departure to the New World was an induction into proper practicing.  She helps Edward with a chronic toothache, picking out the herbs his spirit companion helped her find, and in this, provides her own security.  They know each other for five years, meeting in private to talk, Edward to speak of his strict father and shrewish mother, Henrietta to let her mind wander out her mouth in endless streams of ideas, fantasy, hopes, fears, and wonderings.  He copies and shares pages from the collection of texts his family brought over, giving them to her as a gift, wrapped like a scroll around flowers he’s picked.  She and an older girl were brought into the family from the girls’ home to help a family of one man and three older boys cook, clean, and sort things out.  The older girl married the father a year ago, and Henrietta is expected to marry one of the boys, an expectation that shapes her nights and mornings in the household.  Her every day is so dull she likens it to bashing her head repeatedly into the log walls.  Her thoughts are further numbed by darkness, pain, scrubbing, and stove smoke, ‘livened up’ only by the pressures from the older boys, who act when their father isn’t looking, to try to bully her into their embrace and eventual betrothal.  The older girl who is effectively her stepmother condemns her for every rude word overheard from the boy’s lips, every vulgarity on their parts, every time she finds Henrietta standing in the corner, eyes on the ground, hands clutching at something- anything, even one another, white-knuckled, while the oldest of the boys stands too close.  The boys go no further than this and leering at her, out of fear of their father, but the fact they go this far is a mark against Henrietta in her stepmother’s eyes, to be punished with more scrubbing.  Winter is hell, Henrietta has told Edward.  Winter means they stay indoors, unless wood needs to be cut, the food dull and stretched thin, six people and a baby in a cabin that would feel small for four, the odors of smoke, cooking grease, and unwashed bodies filling up the room until her head pounds with every breath she takes for weeks on end.  Months on end spent in their company, her stepmother’s words biting, Henrietta the scapegoat for everything that goes wrong, even the baby deciding to shit and cry.  Her only relief is the drugs she’s able to concoct, that relax tempers and render men flaccid, counteracted by the medicine she takes herself so she can remain sharp.  For five years, she has endured these winters.  For five years, she has looked forward to meeting Edward in the spring.  For five years she picked the herbs and medicines she needs for the five months of winter, and traveling for a day and a night on this sixth year, knowing she’ll catch a beating for getting herself ‘lost’, she can’t find any more.  They’ve been picked clean by her own hands.  Even the spirit companion cannot find more.  She has not been bullied into any of the boy’s ’embraces’, but the notion of betrothal is not far off, but instead overdue, postponed by the squabbling between the boys and the father’s knowledge the one who marries her will take her away.  If someone gets impatient and the father grows tired of his sons squabbling, it might even come to pass partway through the winter.  Marriage to a brother, allowed because they aren’t blood.  She panics, contemplates dark things, like drugs of the worst sort, to turn her into a monster strong enough to kill her family, or ways to erase their will.  Edward catches her, holding her tight.  It is meant to be their goodbye to one another before next spring and she is out of her mind with fear over what the long stinking darkness across winter might bring, ruining that goodbye, which prompts further panic – what if she comes next spring and he isn’t there?  Edward makes his offer.  Escape.  His betrothal.  His cabin instead of her adopted father’s.  She accepts, leaving everything behind, and the following weeks are a whirlwind.  She meets his family and they are glad Edward has found another practitioner who isn’t a rival, their cabin is lit by spirit, bright compared to the dark room with six people and one window with a shutter that controls the outflow of smoke, lets the cold air in, but that provides some of the only light that isn’t from the fire.  The food is good, and she helps in the kitchen.  She feels like a character from a fairy tale, a wayward girl abandoned by one family and picked up by another she didn’t want.  The evil stepmother, the grim fate- and it did feel like fate clutching at her.  She worries at the same time, because the fairy tales often had the most unhappy of endings.  The mermaid turned to sea foam, the princesses dead.  The fear comes true, but not as she thought.  Years of being on guard against men has her unable to even kiss Edward without her body tensing, her breath seizing in her lungs.  The more these fears come to evidence, the worse the experience.  She worries at the sadness in Edward’s eyes, if this fairy tale might end in some bitter irony, her prince turning away because he can’t understand why her breath and body act the way they do.  She concocts her solution.  Edward reluctantly helps.  A drug to mirror herself, transform her mind and body from sweet and gentle young lady Henrietta to the licentious woman Arietta.  Only a little, only with Edward, and only to unlock the feelings caged deep inside, that she does feel for him.  With that, the fears slip away, it gets easier and easier.  Only a dose to transform, now and then, such as when the coming winter of year seven brings old fears with it, renewing that entrapment of her breath in her throat.  While shopping on the week of Christmas on year eight, visiting a nearby town, she finds her elder ‘brother’ and his new wife.  He tries to accost her, and Edward stops him.  Angry, he storms off.  A little bit later, while they are at Church, their home is raided and ransacked.  Among the things taken are papers.  While transformed, Henrietta’s alter ego was incautious with her words, and made promises- still ones Henrietta might have made, but because Henrietta’s memory isn’t always Arietta’s, Edward thought it wise to write down those promises, in case they were keeping.  This sets the stage where the Carmine is expected to judge.  Wondering at the disappearance of his once-putative fiancee, the eldest brother wrote overseas to the home for orphaned and wayward girls.  One of Henrietta’s peers who used to be the most wayward was now the most devout, and she thus thought it appropriate to tell him of the contracts Henrietta had made with ungodly forces, that she was bound to truth, among other things she had learned.  The brother finds her again, and he names her forsworn.  She made promises, sober and of her own mind, that contradict oaths she made as Arietta, not truly herself, inebriated on chemicals, less binding.  On the one hand, she is to repay family, she is to honor father and mother, she is to wed one of her brothers.  That last extracted in a moment of desperation.  On the other, Arietta has sworn heart and body to Edward.  She swore to repay him for being her savior, to wed him.  These contradict.  The Carmine Beast has not been invited to this scene of forswearing, but in the clashing of two promises, spirits aren’t readily equipped to act.  She judges.  Lucy sat back in the throne.  “I’m supposed to make this call?” Lucy asked the empty clearing, ground and wood around her stained in blood, the leaves red.  She raised a hand, and the shapes Edward and Henrietta emerged from the soil, drawn out in crimson.  The events and details were there for her to reach out to as much as the faces were.  “She was only ten when she was brought into the family,” Lucy said.  “Correct,” the Alabaster said.  She strode into the clearing from a point opposite Lucy.  “Pardon the intrusion.  I thought you should have guidance for your first major task.”  “As a child, the oaths she made… should they really count?”  “The notion of the ‘child’ was only trending out of favor in that era,” the Carcass in Sable said, voice soft, with a faint ragged edge to it that Lucy’s earring could pick up.  “She was old enough to awaken, if we grant her words the gravity required for her to practice, we must grant them the gravity to condemn her.”  “If you wish to rule so the young cannot make oaths, running against all set precedent,” the Gold-Furred Mouse said, running along a branch and landing atop the very edge of the throne, “you’d have to undo all workings she’s wrought.  That takes power, Carmine.  Power you would deprive yourself of for other, future decisions and actions.”  “It doesn’t necessarily save her,” the Alabaster Doe said.  Lucy moved so they formed more of a square, so the Alabaster was to her left, the Gold-Furred Mouse to her right, the Sable across from her.  The images of the pair sat in the center of the clearing.  “It might,” Lucy said.  “If you strip away her practice, and rule so that the young cannot bear oath or awakening in this region, you’ll face pressure from the outside,” the Gold-Furred Mouse told her.  “She would be stripped of tools that have thus far saved her from many bad fates.”  “But she wouldn’t be forsworn.”  “She might wish she was, Carmine Child,” the Alabaster Doe said.  “Teenager,” Lucy muttered.  “I don’t have the impression that the forsworn usually think they got off easy.”  “No.  But in this scenario that ends with her being forsworn, she loved and lost,” the Carcass in Sable told Lucy.  “Lost everything.  She got to meet Edward.  She had a good few weeks.”  “That’s not the selling point you think it is.  I’m giving this relationship a C+ at best,” Lucy said.  “Too old.”  “Different times, less options,” the Mouse told her, from its perch on the arm of the throne.  “Still.  This isn’t a love for the ages, worth the utter destruction of her self, practice, and everything else.”  “Perhaps not,” the Alabaster Doe told Lucy.  “But without this, perhaps she might not have had any good moments at all.  Forsworn in all intents and purposes.”  The scene in the center of the clearing changed.  Henrietta, married to the eldest brother.  As the light shone in her face, there was a flash of color- Lucy could look deeper to see the scene as it might’ve unfolded.  A long winter, every winter.  “Can I like… just say no?” Lucy asked, looking at the three.  “Forswearing not granted, fuck you, eldest brother guy, you eat the forswearing instead?”  “On what grounds?” the Gold-Furred Mouse asked.  Lucy searched her brain for an answer, then said, “Arietta wasn’t Henrietta.”  “You may say no,” the Carcass in Sable told her.  The scene changed again, animated.  Henrietta and Edward together.  The eldest brother dropping to his knees.  Hairs on Lucy’s arms stood on end as she saw the look on Henrietta’s face change, realizing what had happened.  From defeat to joy, to a victory she’d never thought she’d have.  Lucy could see deeper, could see swords that were crossed in Henrietta’s chest separating, no longer trapping breath in her throat.  She would still struggle, but the road to victory was open.  She had closure.  She walked over to her brother, and she slipped from being Henrietta to being Arietta, without needing the drug at all.  She bent down and kissed her brother on the cheek.  “You know so little of what you’re dealing with, and now you’ve paid the ultimate price.”  “Henrietta?” the bloody image of Edward asked.  She startled, and turned to face him.  “The brother falls, Henrietta bears a child in wedlock to a husband she freely loves,” the Carcass in Sable proclaimed.  The image changed to show Henrietta with Edward, holding twin children.  “Two children?” Lucy asked.  “The other is Arietta’s.  If you’ve decided Arietta’s words are not Henrietta’s, then they are her own.  Henrietta is freed from her need for her alter ago, but her alter ego still exists buried.  She emerges on her own now, fights for a presence in the world.  In the midst of the struggle of childbirth, one child produced, the other lodged in the canal, Henrietta changes and it is Arietta’s body that bears the other child into the world.  The division existed in the womb.  One child is an angel, figuratively speaking, the other… wayward.”  “A bitter struggle,” the Gold-Furred Mouse declared.  “Arietta existing for moments a day, sometimes longer.  Henrietta wouldn’t understand at first what was happening.  She’d wake in the middle of the house, or in the deep woods, shivering.  She didn’t realize Arietta was browsing the same potion-making texts she’d learned the formulas from.  She’d become Arietta in her sleep, mid-nightmare, Arietta would wake, gather what she needed, and then start imbibing potions.”  The scene changed.  All of them stood in a large cabin wrought by Other hands, gifted to the couple by the family.  One child and Edward dead.  The beautiful house with its magic lighting now painted crimson.  Arietta and her daughter looked on, streaked in blood.  Lucy looked away.  “This is but one possibility.  Perhaps Henrietta beats Arietta,” the Alabaster told her.  “Slim chances,” the Gold-Furred Mouse commented, “but a chance.”  Lucy shook her head.  “This says nothing of the consequences,” the Sable told her.  The beautiful corpse approached Edward’s body, lying in blood, trying to shield the good daughter, and brushed his hair into position with fingertips.  “In small ways, this decision reduces the power of one’s word.  Perhaps that’s fair, perhaps drunken words shouldn’t matter as they do… but it still weakens practice.”  “A thousand Others who exist or pass through this region suffer for that weakening of the fabrics they rely on,” the Alabaster said.  “This is the trouble with revolution and upheaval.  The most vulnerable suffer for it.”  “The most vulnerable need it,” Lucy replied.  “Yes.  Very true.”  “Forswearing shouldn’t be a thing,” Lucy said.  “Not used this casually, not… like this.”  “Then the loss is greater,” the Gold-Furred Mouse told her.  “Those who dwell here in this territory lose the benefits of the Seal, they benefit less from the protections, and those who come fresh from a place that does have those benefits and do set the contrast of the words that matter and the forsworn will come here…”  The scene changed.  In the changing, a man very much like Musser stood before Lucy, sword in hand.  The blade was at her throat.  “Conquer the local Others in your region as a whole, conquer us, and replace us four with their own.  Forswearing remains a practice.”  “These expectations create equilibrium,” the Alabaster Doe told Lucy.  “The things that stand out from one region to another will get hammered down to roughly fit what other areas are doing.  Precedent established elsewhere can carry here.”  “Spirits,” the Carcass in Sable said, “will travel between regions, pushing their own influence.”  “And your own efforts, if you wish to establish something different, will require actual attention and effort.  Time will not slow down and wait for you to change the universe,” the Gold-Furred Mouse said.  “And while you attend to one thing, others will carry on as precedent demands,” the Alabaster told Lucy.  Lucy was struck with a distinct memory that was not hers.  She stood on a cliff.  She watched the palisade cities rebuild from damage she had wrought as the Carmine Beast.  While she had wrought that damage, other cities had sprung up.  “So there’s no point?  I’m… a slave to this system?”  “It’s a system you can learn to game, for the smaller things.  Or you can act, but you’d act with the knowledge you’ll be removed and destroyed, and then others will revert what you’ve done.”  Lucy looked around the clearing.  Red leaves, red soil, white trunks and branches.  Bones littered the ground, some sitting there so long the soil had swallowed them up in part.  She had a throne here.  The image of Henrietta and Edward-  It had changed back to them.  Edward held Henrietta, the two of them facing the brother who had just challenged Henrietta on the count of forswearing.  “Forswear the brother,” Lucy decided.  “Henrietta isn’t Arietta.  Henrietta knew she was going to bed Edward, but she didn’t know about what Arietta would swear.  You can’t… you shouldn’t be able to make deals while drugged like that.  A contract wouldn’t count, I don’t think.”  “If you remove the oaths Arietta swore, technically, she still owes her father fealty by oath,” the Carcass in Sable told Lucy.  “Technically, she still must wed a brother.”  “Then that was for the brother to declare.  He chose this angle, earned with words taken by burglary, he gets what he deserves,” Lucy said.  “Even knowing Arietta may come to fight Henrietta, and she’ll likely win?” the Gold-Furred Mouse asked.  “I don’t know what else to do… but I don’t think he should win.  If the idea is that it’s okay to forswear her because she at least got to love Edward before losing everything, she at least gets a few more years and two children with him before it all goes wrong.”  “It destroys both of them and two childhoods, not just her,” the Gold-Furred Mouse told her.  “I don’t know!” Lucy exclaimed.  “I don’t have any freaking idea!   There’s no great answer, or if there is one, use that wisdom and experience, walk me through it!”  “It is not our place,” the Alabaster said.  “You might like our choice less than you do any of the options already presented.”  “I don’t know,” Lucy said, a little defeated.  “What did the real Carmine Beast do?”  “Forswear her,” the Carmine Beast said, using Lucy’s lips, throat, and lungs to produce a growling voice that wasn’t her own.  “Let Henrietta fall to ruin.”  Henrietta dropped to her knees.  “If you need shelter,” the older brother said.  “I’ll grant it, so long as you keep the house for my wife and I.”  “I can grant my own wife shelter, you short-sighted oaf,” Edward said.  “You’ll always have a place with me, my love, whatever the circumstance.”  Henrietta looked up at him with sad eyes.  The Carmine moved her hand, fingers flicking out, as if to brush something away.  Arietta the alter ego turned her head, looked at the older brother and smiled.  The Carmine’s hand closed, crushing the last of Henrietta.  Arietta stood, stretching, still smiling, and strode toward the older brother.  He was strong, but so was she.  Henrietta had been talkative when happy, prattling on, and Arietta was wordless in her victory.  She destroyed the older brother, each strike decisive, aimed at vulnerabilities.  She stood over him, and the man, bearded, large, dressed in functional clothing, held one hand at one tattered ear, blood streaming from one eye and his nose.  His breath came out as wheezes.  He looked up at her with hate.  “The herbs and drugs you and Henrietta gathered, Edward,” Arietta said.  “Bring everything.  I’ll need them for him.  The pages too, while you’re at it.  The ones you copied for her.”  “To mend him?  Are you so merciful?”  “To mend him, yes, but my intent is the furthest thing from mercy.  I’ll take this lout apart, mend him, take him apart again, mend him.  I’ll see how far apart I can get the individual pieces while ensuring he’ll live a long time.”  “I don’t think she would wish to condone something so monstrous.”  “Do this for me, get the things I need, and I’ll be gone.  I expect to live a good while longer.  I can be an ally for your family for generations to come.”  “I want Henrietta back.”  “Henrietta is almost entirely gone.  I can give you a glimpse.  A face, the traces of her.  She won’t be able to respond.”  “Can you give me more?  Is there room for negotiation?”  “I cannot give you more.  There is very little of her remaining, and less with every moment you tarry.  My word is binding in this, sir.”  “Then I will get the things.”  Lucy stood and watched as the rest of the scene unfolded.  Edward found Henrietta kneeling in light snow when he emerged, looking up at him with sad eyes, defeated.  He knelt before her, being careful as he set books and herbs down, and took her hands.  He poured his heart to her, saying his farewell, talking of brighter times, and elicited a smile from her.  As his eyes welled up with tears, so did Lucy’s.  When the time ran out, Henrietta’s face became the back of Arietta’s head, and the back of Henrietta’s head became Arietta’s face.  Her bones twisted in a painful, rolling transformation as she bent down, collecting the packet of herbs and books in one hand, grabbing her elder brother by the throat in the other.  All that transformation, so the alter ego couldn’t and wouldn’t look back at her husband as she walked off into he woods, to forge her own way, and to spend a few years tormenting the older brother before letting him expire and moving on to other pastures.  “You won’t have our counsel for the occasions that follow, because she didn’t seek it,” the Gold-Furred Mouse told Lucy.  2.  The Leathermen are Animus en masse.  A grouping that grows over time.  With skin like cracked, creased leather, their eyes and mouths are little more than folds in the material, hidden under cloaks and hoods of hide.  There are four in her territory, a fifth emerging.  They are borne of Nature and Fate.  Youths are expected to learn from family, to find their courses in life, but some find themselves at a crossroads.  Such youths may be visited by a Leatherman, offered a choice of three gifts.  Always two bundles – such as two selections of herbs, and the third is a weapon.  It’s a test, a question of character.  Have they learned enough to know if one bundle of food is better than the other?  One may contain poisonous roots, or fish unsuited to eating.  One bundle may be medicinal herbs, the other herbs to inflict rashes.  The weapon is the greedy, selfish choice, a flashy spear a boy could boast about.  A knife that glitters like a jewel.  Those who take the weapon will become murderers.  As of late, the weapons are often steel, like those tools from over the ocean.  Knowing which of the bundles to take and giving to the community means prosperity.  Taking the other means ruin.  Children don’t always remember the visit from the Leathermen, but even the ability to remember the tellings of the prior visits is a strength of character, an ability to listen to wise words and pull out the lessons, to apply them going forward.  Those who listened, know, and remember are at least warned about the weapon, but must still draw on knowledge to pick the right bundle.  The fifth rises and it’s a different sort of Leatherman.  His face is still creased leather, as is all the exposed skin of his body, but he wears the European coats and hat.  He offers the coin, but only in one bundle.  The coinage, spent selfishly, will doom one to destitution.  If spent graciously or given to caretakers, it spells good things.  He carries a weapon, of a craftsmanship that any boy would be proud to have.  “And what about the girls?” Lucy asked.  The Animus rises from ambient sentiment, from ruts and paths carved out in the world, absorbing culture and ideas from the newcomers.  Because it is borne of natural ebbs and flows, she can influence it.  Because of its ties to murder, the propensity to produce conflict, it falls to her.  She can shape it, or quash it.  She can give it direction, setting the course for it.  She was an Animus too, her course defined by her nature.  For the Carmine Beast before it was Carmine, it took more effort to step away from the path than to walk it.  It is the same for them.  “Representing how we choose our futures?  Or… I guess if you’re the kind of kid who picks one thing, I guess you were raised a certain way,” Lucy mused aloud.  “Kid of someone desperate and scraping by might see it as more necessary to take the knife.  Is it really fair that they end up a murderer?”  There was no answer.  The clearing was empty and lonely.  She had to decide whether to set him loose on the population.  What guidelines to set…  Was she really okay having a hand in death and murder?  Even in this simulated reality?  Why did it even matter that she was being asked to make the choices?  Why couldn’t she just watch the Carmine make the choice?  She could understand Verona wanting to really dive in and try stuff out, given Verona’s mixed interests and experimental nature, but…  She looked at the Leatherman, who existed in a sort of stasis, in that broil of blood and conflict.  Was it right to deny him existence?  What if he could become a John Stiles?  “Not murder.  If they choose a selfish path, give them a selfish existence,” she told the Leatherman.  “And do something for the girls, too.  With an appropriate gift that appeals.”  The Carmine Beast unleashed the Leatherman on the Europeans.  It was a brutal sort of fairness.  3.  “For our third round, one on one.  As the holder of the seat, I hold the rights to dictate the nature of the game.  Our gracious judges will determine if it’s fair,” the golden mouse declared.  “The game is the blind bind.  Three dice, each with seven symbols.  Twenty one different symbols in all.  Tossed in the cup, they may trade symbols between one another.”  “A test of memory?” the woman sitting across from the Gold-Furred Mouse asked.  “A blind bind,” the Gold-Furred mouse told her.  “Your third remains in the cup, unseen by you, my third remains in my cup, unseen by me.  Bind all three as appropriate.  I roll…”  The mouse placed three seven-sided dice into the cup and shook it with both paws, demonstrating a strength and steadiness of paw that let him effortlessly manage a cup three times his size.  He tipped it out.  Man, Fire.  He pushed the cup her way.  She looked inside.  The mouse watched her carefully.  “And?” she asked.  “For my binding, steel, stone, and…”  The mouse moved paws in the direction of the other sticks.  It peered up at the woman, then selected a blue stick with a wave to it.  “Are you allowed to look beneath the dice?” the woman asked.  “Mustn’t touch.”  “So my result in the cup could be one of nine?”  “Read the expression on my face.  The twitch of my whiskers.”  “Your face is small and I’ve never spent enough time with vermin to know how whiskers twitch.”  “If you can’t deal with a mere mouse, how could you take the throne of coin and gold?”  The woman looked down at the dice, frowning slightly.  “Fail here and everything you are is forfeit,” the mouse told her.  The woman picked up the dice, examining each side and character, tested the weight of the die, then examined the cup.  “Those are the rules?” the woman asked.  “Guessing what binding might work?”  “The contest is fair,” the Alabaster said.  “Biased in the incumbent throne-holder’s favor, but this is acceptable.”  “You were warned,” the Corpse in Sable told the woman.  “This won’t be easy.”  Lucy knew she wasn’t meant to speak, so she kept her observations to herself.  There were more than one kind of binding, which meant there were multiple combinations of sticks that worked.  A positive binding would mean it was possible to pick something that suited everything, like the mouse had presumably done, charcoal for the fire, steel for the man, and water for what the hidden die was, but…  But the flip side could be true.  Water for the fire, stone for the man, steel for whatever the cup held out of sight.  “Roll,” the Gold-Furred Mouse said.  The woman opened her hand and let two of the dice fall.  “The symbols only change around if the dice is in the cup?” the woman asked.  The mouse was silent.  The dice were the skull and the knife.  She tilted her head left, then right, then looked at the cup.  She pushed it to the mouse.  The mouse scaled the side of the cup, looked down, then dropped back down to the wooden table.  “Hammer, coin… blood.”  The Alabaster approached the table, picking up a cup.  Lucy did the same.  She exerted some power to keep the dice’s facing intact, and let it slide from the cup to the table.  The mouse’s selection was man, entrapped by stone, fire, entrapped by water, and wolf, caged in steel.  The woman’s selection was skull, coins for the eyes, to set it on its way, knife with hammer to forge it, and man, with blood to set him on his way.  “Mine have the advantage of all being beginnings, if we’re tied,” the woman said.  “Did you know or did you guess?” the Mouse asked.  “I guessed.  Fifty-fifty odds.”  “We’re meant to look after fortune.  I’ll let the judges decide.”  “I’ll side with our Mouse,” the Alabaster said.  “Beginnings serve well,” the Sable said.  “I’ll side with the newcomer.”  “Whatever I choose, one of them will die?” Lucy asked.  She thought of John.  “Yes,” the Alabaster said.  “We did say we wouldn’t provide counsel.  I cannot inform your decision.”  Lucy shook her head.  “Whatever you choose, you know the outcome is that the Gold-Furred Mouse doesn’t hold the throne of fortunes in your time,” the Carcass in Sable told Lucy.  “How many more years before the new Aurum comes in?”  “A century.”  “I’m cutting someone’s existence short by that many years, making a decision.”  The others were silent.  She touched the table on the woman’s side.  The Mouse slumped.  “I had things to do.  I had things I was building!”  “I’m sorry,” Lucy said.  The Carmine, standing here, hadn’t apologized.  “The future is bright, I wanted to see it,” the Mouse told them all.  The woman reached down, and the Mouse wasn’t able to avoid the outcome any more than an ant could push a mountain.  The forces now arrayed against him were too many.  The woman bit into his head, tiny bones crunching beneath teeth.  She ended him by pulling his body away without releasing his head from her teeth.  “The golden seat is one with high turnover,” the Carcass in Sable told Lucy.  4.  It was 1940 and two practitioners feuded.  Both were cruel men, in very different ways.  One wreaked havoc in the world, calling violent Others from the Abyss, and the other wreaked havoc in society, an upstanding man in the eyes of community, who nonetheless put children to work and exploited black workers even though slavery had ended roughly a century ago.  Slavery in everything but name, putting men to work in workhouses and keeping them on company scrip.  Bedraggled, violent, glaring, the Scourge shouted, “You called me an ally!  You promised to elevate me!  You owed me more!”  “It doesn’t change the fact that you brought danger to my house despite pledging to keep it safe!  My daughter-!”  “Your daughter faced the risk she did because of your carelessness!  You can’t ask me to keep your safety if you’re going to leave doors unlocked when you know the work I do!”  Lucy couldn’t bring herself to care.  They had grim histories, blood shed, people abused, both arrogant in their own ways.  It reminded her of Musser.  They’d each charged the other with a violation of oaths.  Forswear them both, she thought.  The world would be better off.  But the promises to elevate were implied, not outright stated, and offers had been made.  They hadn’t been good offers, but they’d been offers, and they’d been turned down.  The world was in upheaval, a war on the horizon, but practitioners had largely agreed to keep out of those affairs.  It was the business of Man, not Other, and much of the fighting that happened over here was behind the scenes, old and established families picking sides.  Lucy felt saddened to see so many actually siding with Nazi Germany.  They pointed to heritage and old alliances, they pointed to the need for power.  She didn’t have the grounds to act against the Upstanding Man, so she let him forswear the Scourge, and she told herself she’d keep an eye on the Upstanding Man, who sided with Germany and exploited the people.  The Carmine Beast kept a close eye on him.  He never gave her an excuse, and thus he thrived.  5.  “An animal must eat if it’s to persist in a long journey,” the Alabaster said.  The Carmine dozed on her throne, head on the arm, looking at the intruder into her space.  “You won’t last for long, Carmine, if you don’t eat.”  “We don’t need sustenance.”  “We need things,” the Alabaster told her.  “As a beast you mated.”  “I can’t give birth.”  “Yet you mated.  You sought partners for base instinct.  You found something in that.”  “I’m not what I was.”  “You become less than what you are every passing year.  This job is necessary, the universe will feed you, but it won’t help you hold your shape or focus.”  “The solution to that is to rut?”  “The options are limited.  You cannot destroy without a multitude of complications.  You used to upend settlements, terrify hundreds-”  “I didn’t enjoy that.  I did it because-”  “Because you needed to, Carmine,” the Alabaster Doe said.  “See to needs.  Somehow.  Or your tenure will resemble that of the Aurum line.  Twenty-one years of mouse, thirty of dame, now the practitioner fused with familiar as our Aurum Coil.”  Lucy sighed.  “A man will come to hunt me tomorrow.  He has until dawn to catch me.  If the sun rises and he can’t give up the hunt or see that glimmer-”  “I’ll seize him in my jaws.”  “Thank you, that simplifies matters,” the Alabaster Doe told her.  She looked around the great, empty clearing.  “I’m sorry to disturb.”  “I used to hunt prey animals too, Alabaster.  What if my needs are for me to seize your arm in my jaws and bite until the bone cracks?  Or your neck?”  “It wouldn’t kill me.  Not if you did it.  If that’s what you need, Carmine, partake,” the Alabaster told her.  “I don’t mind.”  Lucy shook her head.  She turned her head to look.  The Alabaster’s flock waited by the entrance to the Carmine’s clearing.  People as young as seventeen and old as seventy, dressed in simple shifts of white.  The Alabaster bowed slightly, then turned to go.  Her handmaidens and handservants followed.  The youngest girl skipped up to catch up to the Alabaster, and the Alabaster stroked her hair.  They exchanged murmurs, the Alabaster smiling.  “Them?” she asked the Alabaster’s back.  “Your protected flock?  Could I hunt them?”  “You could.  I warned them before they came that there was risk you might.  These are the ones who were willing to accept it.  They won’t evade you very well, if at all.  They’d be a morsel for you.”  “And the ones who weren’t willing?”  “You won’t find them, even if you try accessing my domain.  It’s universal law.”  She contemplated hunting them anyway.  She contemplated scaring them, making them regret agreeing to come.  It was like the throne.  Too easy, effortless.  Pointless.  She rose to her feet, stretching.  She was fully aware of her domain, and much as she could pull on that domain to raise up an Other, if she saw fit, with spirits being the easiest, she could conjure up her own image and let her old self go.  In this way, she could travel with ease within the bounds of the territory.  There were suitors of various sorts, but for most, it was too easy.  What did it matter if she took the Alabaster’s neck in her teeth and bit down and broke the vertebrae, watched her twitch and come to some approximation of death?  What did it matter if she found a man who would take an attractive human female for himself, no real questions, no challenges?  Or an Other who would bow to her will if she so much as looked at it?  She looked for Others instead, and she looked for ones with willpower.  She found an Other in the woods, wrapped in a patchwork of furs.  His body was lithe, face unshaven.  She stood before him, wearing the fur shawl around her otherwise unclothed form, held in place by one hand, the shawl draping and pooling on the ground, where it mingled with her long hair.  The Carmine licked her lips.  “Uhhhhh,” Lucy said, backing away so she was looking at the scene from the side of the path, wearing mask, witch hat, and cloak.  “Cut to black?  Move on?”  The hunter faced her, and he did not shed his own furs.  His eyes studied her.  “How shall we do this?” the Carmine asked, head tilted so she stared at him from just past her slightly-furrowed brow.  “We won’t,” the hunter Other growled.  “No?  There’s no manner in which something could unfold?  I have power-”  “No.”  “I could set you on a path, give answers…”  He shook his head.  “Minutes of your time for conversation,” she offered.  A baring of the throat, a showing of weakness.  “What will it take?”  “I don’t know how this is typically done,” she told him.  “You won’t show me the way?”  He turned to trudge away, carrying weapons and catches behind him.  It was as if time slowed down.  Lucy was left to make a decision.  Loneliness welled inside her, as did a kind of need that had nothing to do with the body and everything to do with the mind.  She felt it swell, compounding with an accumulated weight of centuries.  She thought of what it was to open the application for Class-RankR, and to see herself dead last.  This was that, a thousandfold.  Let him go, she thought.  The beast didn’t let him go.  The beast felt the isolation of her position like a blade had been run through her, and she’d felt it for centuries now.  She moved, and in that moment, Lucy felt glad, on a level, because she didn’t want to experience that loneliness to the degree that the furs would need to demonstrate it.  Glad, for her own welfare, but cringing, otherwise, ready to force a break and quick exit from all of this, even though she hadn’t come close to finding what she needed.  She hadn’t caught up to the present day enough.  They crossed the distance, striding, changing to have longer legs, to be four-legged.  As a canine of roughly two hundred pounds, their shoulder as high up as his, she pounced, leaping.  If she couldn’t have his company, she’d fight him instead.  He reacted, catching them by the ruff of the neck.  He hurled them to the side of the path.  He walked away, ducking beneath tree branches.  She rose to her feet, and resumed human form.  “I would let you be a lieutenant.  There are benefits to be had,” she told him, letting her voice reach through the trees.  “I could make you a lieutenant.”  There was no reply.  She tried, reaching out, testing him.  He was already far, far away.  He let a single fur he was carrying fall, her effort seizing that fur and falling with it.  She could have tried again, but it wasn’t worth the effort.  Not knowing the result- either she exerted her full power and it was trivial, too easy, or this would happen again, and all she’d do was deny him a good share of his catch.  She could have won the fight by the same measure.  She could have exerted will to crush his.  She could have looked deeper to see who and what he was.  But what would come of it?  An interaction without meaning.  She returned to her clearing and her throne.  She could smell the Alabaster’s prey smell, and that of the handmaidens that had taken her offer of sanctuary.  She could smell traces of the hunter from all the way back there, what would be five days of walking away.  The clearing felt large and empty.  Ever a solitary creature, the lone wolf, among other labels, she found herself craving some interaction of even small meaning.  She would go looking on other occasions, Lucy could see.  She would rut, she would even consider lieutenants, but she was so powerful that the only way was to lie, to hide what she was and hold back power.  But to leave someone ignorant meant associating with the ignorant, and that left her dissatisfied.  Most were too easy or too weak to serve under her or rut with her.  The ones who weren’t, or who were less easy and weak didn’t care to talk to her or spend time in her company.  Others had their trajectories and fields of interest and because of where she dwelt, she didn’t fall into those fields or paths.  She existed a step aside and a hundred steps above.  The only sounds in the clearing were the whistling of a violent wind through trees.  6.  She watched as Arietta was bound by practitioners.  Arietta had killed in the years since the Carmine had let her become what she was.  She’d lived multiple generations, found lovers and rivals, and she’d left trails of carnage behind her.  There were no decisions to be made, no distinctions, no influence to be exerted.  Perhaps, if she were inclined, she could have taken Arietta as a lieutenant.  An Other she knew who had dwelt in her territory for some time.  Lucy stood in the Carmine’s place, facing the same decision point.  She wasn’t inclined.  She could understand the sentiment, why the Carmine might want to save her, but a killer?  A dangerous Other?  It…  It was a very similar decision she was being forced to make, every time, with exceptions for the selfish things.  No.  The Carmine didn’t act either.  In this, they were eerily on the same page.  Which was a lack of effort and a degree of concordance that matched up with the Carmine’s experience.  The Carmine was here because there was little to do.  The spirits followed guidance and in all things relating to conflict, they knew the shape of this area and the directions of her will enough that she could leave them be and their decisions resembled her own.  This was a moment of importance.  A realization.  Lucy and the Carmine could do nothing and the spirits would be in line with them.  The more time passed, and the longer the throne was held, the more pronounced that would become.  She was here to mark the end of a story that had begun very close to the start of her own.  Arietta was bound, sealed in a box, and wrapped in chain.  Then they drowned the box, with Arietta inside it.  A chapter of her story closed and the story continued without flinching.  Her actions had ceased to matter.  What purpose was there?  What was she doing here?  7.  “What am I doing here?” Lucy murmured.  She groped for an answer, realized who might be out there, and uttered, “John.”  The furs reached for moments.  She pushed those away.  The Carmine Beast had watched John…  “When she falls,” the Sable Prince said, “you’re our first choice to follow her.  You would have our support.”  John looked at the Aurum Coil, the Alabaster Doe, and the Sable Prince.  “Yalda only just died.  I’m not in a good state to…” he trailed off.  “This is a conversation that may extend for years to come,” the Alabaster Doe told John.  “Begin considering now, so you might be prepared when the time comes.”  “Is she watching?”  “She is,” the Aurum Coil told John.  “She knows you’re arranging things for after her passing?”  “She’s seen us do it for the others.”  “We’re grateful for your willingness to do what needs to be done,” the Sable Prince told John.  “Is there anything you’d want?” the Aurum Coil asked.  “Enticements?”  John gave the man who was mounted on the centipede’s head a dark, wounded look.  Lucy looked away.  “You took the last thing I truly cared about.  Enticements?”  “You’re not a terribly strong Other, John Stiles,” the Alabaster Doe said.  “Not in terms of raw power, not in the sense you could hold your own.  The seat wouldn’t be yours if you sought it out-”  “I don’t think I’d seek it out,” John replied.  “-but if you can find your way from having nothing left to caring about something again, you may be stronger than the Carmine Beast is,” the Alabaster told him.  “We’ll need that strength.”  “A tall order,” John said.  He turned his head the other way, and he looked Lucy in the eyes.  “Someone very unlike Yalda, but who you respect, who respects you in turn?” the Sable asked, looking at her as well.  Lucy shivered.  “Would you do this for her?”  “I don’t even know John at this point in the timeline.”  “I’d need more,” John said, quiet.  “You want to deal?  I want-”  The Sable raised his hand.  The scene went dark, except for Lucy and the Sable.  The man studied Lucy for a long moment, then disappeared, leaving her and John standing in Kennet, no Alabaster or Aurum present.  The Sable leaned in close to whisper something in John’s ear.  She couldn’t hear with the earring.  “What was that?” Lucy asked.  “You’re keeping secrets?”  “Yes,” John said.  Tears came unbidden to her eyes.  Guilherme was turning to Winter and John was keeping secrets.  Paul had picked his mother over a family with her and her mom, and her dad had died.  That loneliness the Carmine Beast had felt sat heavy in her chest, now.  A tear rolled down her cheek, and she smudged it away.  John looked off to the side, pretending he hadn’t seen.  “Are you the real John, or-?”  “Real enough.”  “I didn’t look for that scene, but…”  “I’ve been told not to divulge.  He thinks if I did, you’d stop the real John Stiles.  Can you trust me, Lucy?”  “I don’t know,” she replied, trying to blink away tears.  “If I asked you to be my familiar, would you say yes?”  “That would be nice, wouldn’t it?” John asked.  It wasn’t an answer.  Maybe because this wasn’t the real John.  “I wanted to talk to you because I’m stuck.  These events are passing by and I’m not sure… um, how I’m supposed to be tackling them or steering them.  I feel like the fact that I can’t is supposed to matter.”  “And you picked me to talk to?”  “I thought… she knows of you, you’re in her… field?  Realm?  Area of interest?”  John nodded.  “And you get it, I think.  Because I think what’s tripping me up, and what’s happening with her, is… it happened with you, but you came out of it okay.”  “What is it?” John asked.  “You… stopped being what you are.  You were a soldier and maybe you patrol or stop the occasional Other but it’s not… I don’t feel like it’s the full you, or even most of you.”  “Did she?  Stop being what she was?”  Lucy nodded.  “She doesn’t even know how to find it again.”  “Did you?” John asked, his expression sad.  “I made promises to myself when I was a kid, before I practiced,” Lucy told him, her eyes still moist.  “That I wouldn’t take crap, or let stuff lie.  That… if I could hold to this personal code and if it was the sort of code that everyone could follow, maybe the world would be a bit better of a place.”  “And?  You’ve fought the likes of Alexander.  You face Musser now.”  “After Paul, I realized how awful it feels to be angry, to actually act on it.  I… my element is smoke, apparently.  It’s the one that works best for me.  But isn’t smoke mostly all that’s left after the fires go out?”  “Do you want to be angrier?  To hurt, like fire does, instead of warn?  Because I knew a Blast Dog once who was like that.  I thought Yalda’s singing was a better deterrent.”  “Wasn’t Yalda a victim?”  “I don’t know.”  “And she was dangerous too.  You… had to shoot her.  That’s a scary comparison, I’m not sure that’s better than being an extinguished flame.”  “I don’t think you’re a victim, Lucy, and I don’t think I’ll have to shoot you.  Even with this gulf between us.”  “Gulf?”  “From that night.  From Alexander.”  She visualized Alexander, head cracked open, and looked away.  “I let stuff slide when I was out on a date with Wallace.  Stuff I might’ve been angrier about before.  And the people who said that stuff don’t know better, and they don’t know better because I didn’t say anything more.  I went easy on them to keep things… nice.  And it doesn’t feel nice.  I made up with Paul and it doesn’t feel nice.”  Her words came out faster, “Avery was asking me about compromises and what we were willing to do with Charles and…”  “I thought the way forward you settled on was a good one, with Charles.”  “I think we picked the wrong people to do the wrong parts of this Carmine Furs thing.  Because the Carmine’s in the same place I am, she doesn’t know what to do with herself.  She’s cut off.”  “I think, whichever one of you came, there’d be things that were difficult.  For Verona, she would get distracted in the nuance of having a kind of godlike power.  For Avery, the loneliness would crush her.  For you…”  “Justice.  A lack of justice.  A lack of- I can’t change this world, John, and that’s terrifying.”  “You can, but it’s hard.  It takes small steps.”  “I can’t even steer this into the topic I need and want.  I need to know what the conspirators were doing.  I need to know what secret you’re keeping.  Because you’re going away and it seems like you’re dead set on becoming the Carmine and it’s such a dead end, John!” She raised her voice, tears in her eyes again.  “It is what you make it.  If you’re at a dead end when you take the seat, you’ll hardly move from that.”  “What other ways are there?”  “Purpose,” John said, touching his chest.  “Escape.  Justice.  To rescue.  Anger, for the Carmine.  The Choir might have taken the position through power and they might’ve done it out of a hunger for power.  That’s what they are.  What they were made to be.”  “Can you help me steer this, John?”  “I’m only a figment, a model of John Stiles stored in memories, yours and hers.  I can’t move far from this scene or the scenes I was in.  But with luck, I’ll be out there when you exit, if you want to stop in and talk to me.”  “Will you tell me what the deal you made is?”  “No.”  Her heart sank.  Another tear rolled down her cheek.  Frustrated, she didn’t stop it.  “If I take the throne and hold it, I’ll be a day’s travel away.”  “If you take it and you don’t hold it, that’s it.  It’s a dead end and there’s nothing past that.  I don’t think there’s a way to be deposed without being destroyed.”  John nodded once.  Disgusted, frustrated, she turned away from John.  “The Choir was a contender, yeah?” she asked.  “I was supposed to check on something about the Choir.  I’d say thanks for the reminder, but I’m pretty mad at you right now.”  He didn’t respond.  She strode out into the darkness.  At least she had a bit of anger now, something to help her find her way to the moments she needed, before she ran out of time.  That’s seven minutes spent, out of eleven and a half.  8.  A version of Charles with a bit more hair hugged papers and books to his chest, a lantern on a chain dangling from one hand.  The wind blew against him, and the wet grass slid underfoot, roots not holding, turning footing into ground that was more treacherous than mud alone might be.  He lost pages.  A younger Edith grabbed some out of the air.  As Charles looked back, Edith’s eyes glowed.  “I hope that lost page wasn’t important.”  “It was,” Charles muttered.  “I don’t know what page it was, but if it was taken from me it had to be important.  I thought I had protection, to make things easier.”  “I think your actions right now aren’t for Kennet, or in line with promises you made to get that protection.”  He hissed a curse word under his breath.  The field stretched out before him, and in the twilight, the grass was emerald, the sky a navy blue.  Light was dim, even, and ambient, to the point that he, Edith, and the papers seemed illuminated.  The wind whipped violently around them.  “You’ve saved me more times than I can count.  You helped make me who I am today.  I’ll help you, at least.”  “Help me arrange the setpieces,” he said, brusque.  “Weigh down the papers.”  The preparations took two hours.  They might have taken one and a half if Charles hadn’t been hampered like he was.  Power sources.  He had four.  The lantern from Edith was one.  The diagram was set out on the field.  Bags of crushed limestone were emptied.  The Girl by Candlelight came and returned, carrying more stacked on one shoulder, the other hand bearing the candle.  All arranged.  A celestial diagram, nuanced, annotated with script carefully laid out with stones arranged to spell words and lay out instructions.  Much of it was a shorthand, utilizing symbols and arrangement as much as the words themselves.  Edith and Charles donned their masks.  “I can’t do this part,” Charles said.  “You’re more capable of practice than I am.”  “How do I do this, then?” Edith asked.  “Utter the instructions.  This is transfer of power.  Powering parts of the diagram.  As a spirit and elemental, you can do that much.”  “Walk me through this.  I don’t speak Latin.”  “I’ll make notes.”  Charles began scribbling on the page.  Edith watched over his shoulder.  “Who else?” Lucy asked the night.  There was nobody else.  Nobody yet.  A conspiracy of two.  Edith was only part of this for loyalty, not ideology.  “Okay,” Lucy murmured.  An Other began to come into being.  A living ritual.  A trap meant for practitioners.  Time seemed to slow down.  The point she could make a decision.  Lucy looked at the outcomes, if she decided not to do anything.  The Abyssal forces in the lantern tainted the working.  Charles had expected it, but he hadn’t expected it to be so cruel.  Lucy watched as the trap unfolded.  A red tint that took over buildings, changing the letters.  Signs and addresses became scribbled, overlapping text like the handouts had been, just enticing enough that someone felt like there was more meaning to be divined out of them.  Others found their way into the living ritual’s system and transformed, becoming part of that system.  Some were released out as agents.  As Alexander had described happening on the first day of the summer semester, those agents became glyphs, infecting Sight and scrying.  A perpetual figure on the horizon, a swelling power.  Alexander, intrigued, sent his apprentices in to investigate it.  Seth and Nicolette did not return.  Alexander studied it, then ventured in himself, accompanied by Raymond, accompanied by Bristow, by Musser.  The way these things were designed, they always had an out.  A curse that didn’t have a loophole or a secret way of removing it was much harder to wield and apply, in the same way water poured so inconsistently out of a jug if all of the streaming water blocked the aperture.  An escape route let the power swell without straining, pushing other forces out through that route.  Alexander found the out, which would frustrate Charles to bitter ends.  Raymond, Bristow, and Musser didn’t.  Raymond would not find or help Zed.  Bristow would not find or help Clementine.  She’d seen enough.  One possible future, as the Carmine had divined it, but that was all.  “It’s too… too big a weapon,” Lucy murmured.  “The collateral damage is too much, whether it’s the Choir or the Red Heron thing.”  In her memories, the Carmine Beast flicked out a number of fingers, the smallest of gestures.  The violent wind stirred, and as Edith was uttering the words, Charles pacing the perimeter, watching, the diagram simultaneously came to life and changed.  With the Carmine Beast’s will, the letters C and H from ‘cheat’ were scattered.  The stones found other parts of the diagram, connecting circles meant to be isolated.  The wind blew the lantern over.  “No!” Charles shouted.  Abyssal, elemental power flowed from the lantern to a line it wasn’t meant to touch, and power swelled in a central part of the diagram.  Yalda’s power, marked out with links to Charles’ blood, mingled with Abyssal power.  It drew on the incarnate forces, and Charles could see a glimmer of the Sick Dog in the midst of it all.  Lines moved and expanded, as if they were breathing, lifting up off the ground and moving away, finding new configurations.  Yalda’s unconscious will.  “No, no, no!” Charles screamed into the wind, and the wind muted him.  He leaped over lines, stumbling, and slipped as the grass’s roots broke and he skidded on mud again.  The Hungry Choir was born, and the Carmine Beast had helped bring it to pass.  She’d done so out of anger.  A frustration at being left out.  A resentment over the fact that they were already picking her replacement.  They’d set her on this path, they’d used her for hundreds of years, and now they would move on.  She would be forgotten, those few Others and entities she’d interacted with gone.  Any other Others were too far below her.  What mark could she make, besides this?  If they were to remove or replace her, let them do it for a reason.  9.  Edith lit up a cigarette.  At the edge of the woods, it was the only light except a sliver of moon.  Charles stood near her, swatting at the bugs that seemed intent on devouring him.  Maricica dropped out of the sky, wings fluttering without flapping, still breaking her fall.  The lighting changed with her arrival, the scant light shining past patterns in her feathers to sharpen the diffuse light into glints and sparkles rather than dimming them or diffusing them further.  She wrapped the wings around herself.  “Is she watching?” Charles asked.  “You only ask that now?” Maricica asked him.  “I thought myself beneath her notice.”  “You were proven wrong in that thinking when she spoiled your ritual to create a trap for Alexander.”  Charles sighed.  There was deep sadness in his eyes as he felt the weight of the casualties.  “This remains your show, Charles,” Maricica said.  “It’s you front and center at the end of this.”  “Why would you say that when you admit she’s watching?” Charles asked, angry.  “There’s a purpose,” Edith said.  She sounded tired.  “Isn’t there?”  “It doesn’t change anything, Charles,” Maricica said.  “It’s my show, but I’m supposed to do what you say, when you say it, no choice?  That’s what you told me, months ago,” Charles told her.  “Don’t sound so petulant, cullion worm.  At this stage enough of the pieces are arranged that there is little choice to be had.  Consider me the director.  You created this weapon, we’re aiming it at her now, and the Carmine Beast knows we’re doing it.  There is no way this unfolds or goes the way you wish it to without careful orchestration,” Maricica said.  “You’re forsworn, you’ve already seen that if you have any real ability to shape what follows, you’ll spoil it.  You held the reins at the start, and you’ll have them at the end.”  At the end? Lucy thought.  Charles?  Against John?  “You, Edith, will have Kennet and Matthew both.”  “And what do you get?” Edith asked.  Maricica smiled.  “You won’t say?  Of course,”  Edith sighed the words.  “What next?”  “The pieces are arranged.  I’ve talked to them.  Two Others in particular will help, another will be steered this way.  Miss will be unseated, by fostering a lack of confidence in her, or by other means.  You’ll have a position of leadership for long enough to bring those pieces into Kennet.  The pieces we don’t have can be manufactured.  Charles.”  “I have few tools left.”  “You won’t need any except your voice, to make a suggestion and an argument.”  “People don’t listen to my arguments.”  “That’s an advantage of sorts unto itself.  No, we shall set things up with the intention of knocking them down.  A strawman ploy of sorts.  But that matters little.  I asked you to meet-”  “I was wondering if you would get to it.”  “Mind your tone, Charles.  You’re not of a stature or position to challenge me.”  “Yet,” Edith said, quiet.  Maricica smiled wide, her eyes dark and inhuman in the shadows.  “Yet.  As I told you, you need to do and say what I ask of you, and the pieces will fall into place.”  “What must I do or say?”  “Others who are strong and little else are hard to come by, here.  Miss would turn them away, and people would wonder why you’re gathering an army.  I have a task for you, and it won’t be now or even soon.”  Charles gave her a wary look with tired eyes that had bruised bags beneath them.  “The goblins.  Gashwad and Bluntmunch.  Our pieces are in place, but this will go more smoothly if we have distractions and obstacles, so that whatever practitioner Miss chooses will be confounded and slowed down.  I’m reluctant to involve them, but they serve our needs, they’re already here, and there are weaknesses we can exploit.  They resent Toadswallow, even if they can’t articulate that resentment.”  “You want me to talk to them?”  “Later.  Toward the middle of summer, when I’m more distant from things.  Offer them a deal.  Bluntmunch wants power, Gashwad wants to matter.  The sooner I give you this instruction and the more removed from it, the less it will stink for them.  Buy their loyalty.  I’ll give you the currency.”  “What are they meant to do?” Edith asked.  “Distract?  Delay?  Is there a specific time or place?”  “There will be, but their true purpose is to give you two confidence in this plan.  I remain confident without their involvement, but you can’t see the outcome yet.  Having them to protect the pieces as we put them into action will mean you don’t hesitate when it counts.”  “Thin,” Charles said, looking displeased.  “Shallow manipulation to our faces?”  “Deeper manipulation beneath.  Yet it gives all of us what we want, and Kennet what it needs.  This will be our last meeting before the Carmine Beast dies at the hands of the Choir.  If we meet again, there’s a chance Miss will be on the alert and notice what we’re doing.  Or the practitioner she chooses will.  Barring incident, we’ll meet after, to discuss the practitioner, and then again, to talk about the day it all comes to pass.”  “There’s no backing out?” Charles asked.  “You have no ground to retreat to, Charles, you haven’t for a long time,” Maricica told him.  “We’re all on paths that were decided for us.  Yours ran you right into the mud, Edith’s will take her far from Matthew.  Yet if you let me arrange it properly, these set paths will result in a grisly collision that pushes each and nearly every one of us out of position.  You’ll have your justice, despite everything, Edith will have Matthew, despite everything, and I’ll have what I want, despite everything.  The sole exception will be hers-”  Maricica pointed directly at the Carmine Beast, who watched from a day’s travel away.  “-which will destroy her, ending her futile, pathetic, and pointless existence,” Maricica said.  The Carmine Beast’s anger burned so hard in her chest that it startled Lucy from the scene.  10.  The Carmine Beast prowled forward.  Her size could span the entire territory she managed, but for now she suited herself by being as tall as the treetops were.  “You’re so small,” the Carmine Beast snarled.  “And you, Carmine Beast, are vanishing in your significance,” Maricica said.  She unfurled her wings as wide as they would go, then stretched out further.  The forms she wore in shadow were revealed, insectile, vile, as ugly as her human body was beautiful, as bent as she was slender.  Still Fae, still entrancing.  “You bait me.”  “I do.”  “I don’t have to answer by acting myself.  I could eat you, yes, but I could send the worst sort of Other after you.  Goblin after goblin.  Unceasing.  I know where to find you.  It is my right to rub out an existence I see as more harmful than good.”  “You could,” Maricica said.  “But I can give you what you want.”  “You would destroy me.”  “Interesting how those are one and the same, when you don’t wish to die or be destroyed.  Do you know what your fatal flaw is, Carmine?”  “Enough words.”  “You’re so desperate for a peer on your own level that you lower yourself to ours.  You could do more, but you won’t, because it’s so very lonely at the top,” the Faerie said.  “Lucy.”  Zed’s voice.  “And with that,” Maricica said.  “You leave yourself vulnerable, held back, smaller than you should be, while you, as I said, vanish in significance.”  “Lucy, Verona thinks your count is wrong.  You haven’t been counting the scenes you’re in right.”  Maricica moved her wings, stirring them.  Vast as they were, they shifted leaf, dust, and grass.  Small insects took to the air.  “Lucy, when’s the last time you had a thought of your own?”  And, the Carmine saw, a small Fairy of the Dark Fall court held something in its hand.  The movement of air blew that something from hand to air.  The Carmine Beast blinked, hard, as a stabbing pain penetrated the orb of her eye.  “The sharpest thistle from a field of thistles, all grown untouched by light,” the monstrous Maricica told her.  “Left greedy, even, for that light, as you’re greedy for something else.”  “We’re pulling you out.”  “That’s it,” Maricica said.  She drew herself together.  She looked different to the Carmine’s eye.  The Carmine blinked fiercely, shaking her head for a moment.  “Curse set, to take the light from your eyes and blind you to certain things.  Everything in motion.  By the end of spring, you’ll die and be butchered ignobly.  By the end of summer-”  “Charles Abrams will have your throne,” Lucy finished.  “It’s fine.  I’m out, pulling out- just gotta find the door…”  🟂  Lucy, drenched in river water, stirred, blinking madly as she tried to make sense of what was around her.  Reminding herself of reality.  “You got in deep,” Zed said.  “Spooked us.”  “Really spooked us,” Verona said.  Lucy nodded, swallowing.  “How did I lose count?”  “The Sable,” Zed said.  “He punctuated the end of one scene and brought about another.  You didn’t count that.”  Lucy made a face, shaking her head.  “Zed.  It’s Charles.  Charles apparently takes the throne, unless that thorn was meant to reach me, here-”  “That’s the kind of thinking about Faerie that messes us up,” Avery said.  “I think it’s okay.”  Lucy shook her head.  “No, my point is, you said Raymond was hard to get in touch with.  A few times.  You said that was usual, but…”  Zed’s expression changed.  He went to get his phone.  Lucy accepted help in standing.  Her body didn’t feel quite like hers.  She had to triple check her eyes and Sight worked okay, in case being so connected to the Carmine as the curse was applied had affected her.  Avery gave her clean bottled water to rinse her eyes with, to be safe.  “Charles?” Verona asked.  “As the mastermind?”  “As the person at the start and the end.  Um, Maricica taking over in the long stretch of middle to keep his forsworn nature from twisting things out of their control.  But Charles is meant to take the Furs, and Charles…”  “Is still in captivity,” Zed said.  “Ray’s on the phone.  He’s got Charles.  He knows his stuff.”  “Are you sure it was Ray?” Lucy asked.  “Pretty sure.  Faerie and Technomancy don’t usually jibe.”  That out of the way, Lucy walked them through everything.  Every step, including Charles.  “Can we bribe the goblins?” Verona asked.  “And… do something about Ken?  The strawman ploy?”  “We have options,” Lucy said.  “And a week to put them into effect.”  “And one more Alcazar ritual to do?” Avery asked.  “After dinner,” Zed said.  “Verona’s still woozy, you’re wobbly, and I’d rather have you guys on your best if we’re having Avery tackle the hard part.”  “Oh boy,” Avery said.
