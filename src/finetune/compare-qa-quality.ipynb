    "- The execution time doesn't seem to directly correlate with the top-K of the retriever\n",
    "- The difference in execution time has some correlation with the question, but the minimum times are similar (1 sec) while maximum times are highly variable (4-40 seconds)\n",
    "- 400-token preprocessed data tends to skew higher by ~30%\n",
    "- Embedding model had the highest impact on performance with average performance for distilbert / finetuned performance being 50% slower, worst-case being 75% slower, and best-case being 100% slower.\n",
    "- Finetuned model loves to say \"I don't know if this is what you've looking for\"\n",
    "- 400 seems to maybe be a little long, but 100 too short.\n",

    "- Verona Sight : Ok, low word-count documents are generally better though typical distilbert is bad. Top-k doesn't matter past 10, but that might be a limitation of the Generator. Not super accurate.\n",
    "- Carmine Dead: All slightly wrong but very similar.\n",
    "- Matthew: low-length finetuned is the best, everything else gets too inventive.\n",
    "- Snowdrop: BERT has no clue, and other are roughly the same (with some generative weirdness)\n",
    "- Awakening Ritual: Distilbert did good, but longer passages were needed to properly build the context.\n",
    "- Miss: Completely lost (ha)\n",
    "- Forest Ribbon Trail: not too bad ona ll 3, the larger context better.\n",
    "- Toadswallow: all bad\n",
    "- Alpeona: Not great\n",
    "- Hungry Choir: Tuned and distilbert all goood, but longer context important.\n",
